This directory contains examples of each stage of the compilation
process.  The example code is *huge*, so I compressed each example
with bzip2.  Bzip2 compresses these files far better than gzip.  You
can get bzip2 from  http://www.bzip.org/

For the impatient among you,
 1) unbzip the file wx_medio.p.bz2 to get wx_medio.p.scm
 2) load evil.ss
 3) load wx_medio.p.ss
 4) (compile-top-level wx-medio)

The file wx_medio.p.scm was generated from Ed Willink's FOG parser.
