The board consists of a 4 by 4 grid of positions.  Each player has 3
stacks of 4 nesting pieces each for a total of 12 pieces.  The object
of the game is to get four of your pieces visibly in a row, but since
the pieces nest, your opponent can obscure some of your pieces by
covering them with some of his.

The board starts empty and play alternates between players.

A player starts with three stacks of nested pieces.

On each turn, a player must move an exposed piece of his color.

There are two kinds of moves:  a regular move is from one position on
the board to another position on the board.  An `entering' move is
from off-board to on-board.  Pieces are never removed from the board.

For a regular move, a piece may move to a position if the position is
*not* occupied by a piece of the same size or larger.  If the position
is occupied by a smaller piece, the moving piece will cover it.  You
may cover your own pieces.  Moving a piece will expose whatever was
underneath it.

For an entering move, a player takes the topmost piece from one of his
stacks and places it either on an empty position, or covers one of his
own pieces.  It is not permitted to cover an opponents piece on entry
*with one exception*:  if three exposed opponent pieces are aligned (on
a row, column or one of the two primary diagonals), then one of those
pieces may be covered.

A player may not move a piece that is not exposed, and may not make an
entering move with a piece that is not exposed.

You are not permitted to `peek' under a piece.

If one player has 4 exposed pieces in a row at the end of a turn, he
wins.  If both players have 4 exposed pieces in a row at the end of a
turn, it is a draw.  If the same position is repeated 3 times, a
player may claim a draw.
