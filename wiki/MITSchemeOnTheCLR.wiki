Here's how to bootstrap ab initio.

You will need a native version of MIT Scheme in order to generate the initial set of binary files.  If you do not have this, you cannot do an ab initio bootstrap.  In addition, you will need the MIT Scheme source files.

Start up MIT Scheme and make sure the SF program is loaded (it is preloaded in the compiler band).  Perform these steps:
{{{
(cd "path\\to\\mit-scheme\\src\\runtime\\")

(load "runtime.sf")

(cd "..\\sf\\")

(load "sf.sf")

(cd "..\\microcode\\")

(sf "utabmd.scm")
}}}
This will create the initial set of binaries.  These binaries are in the native MIT Scheme format, but don't worry, the C# code knows how to read them.  

Move the .bin, .crf, .fre, .pkd, from the runtime directory to the <solution>\\BootstrapLib\\Runtime\\ directory.

Move the .bin, .crf, .fre, .pkd, from the sf directory to the <solution>\\BootstrapLib\\Sf\\ directory.

Move utabmd.bin from the microcode directory to the <solution>\\BootstrapLib\\Runtime\\ directory.

Using MIT Scheme again, 
{{{
(cd "solution\\BootstrapLib\\Runtime\\")

(sf "site.scm")
}}}

Once you do this, you ought to be able to start Scheme and get to the prompt.
