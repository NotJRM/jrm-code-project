Here's how to bootstrap ab initio.

You will need a native version of MIT Scheme in order to generate the initial set of binary files.  If you do not have this, you cannot do an ab initio bootstrap.  In addition, you will need the MIT Scheme source files.

Start up MIT Scheme and make sure the SF program is loaded (it is preloaded in the compiler band).  Perform these steps:
{{{
(cd "path\\to\\mit-scheme\\src\\runtime\\")

(load "runtime.sf")

(cd "..\\microcode\\")

(sf "utabmd.scm")
}}}
This will create the initial set of binaries.  These binaries are in the native MIT Scheme format, but don't worry, the C# code knows how to read them.  Copy all the generated files to the <solution&>\\BootstrapLib\\Runtime\\ directory. (You will find the generated files in the mit-scheme\\src\\runtime directory, except for utabmd.bin, which will be in the mit-scheme\\src\\microcode directory.)  

Using MIT Scheme again, 
{{{
(cd "solution\\BootstrapLib\\Runtime\\")

(sf "site.scm")
}}}
