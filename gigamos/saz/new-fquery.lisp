  "Define a documentation function for a ZWEI command.
There are three arguments provided for you:
    COM, the command symbol itself.
    CHAR, the character typed to get this command, or NIL.  If the second
       argument is NIL, that means that the caller does not have any particular
       character in mind (e.g. in List Commands).  The documentation-function
       should be prepared to deal with this case.
    OP, an operation which tells the function what to do.  They are:
       :NAME  Return your name as a string, (e.g. /"Self Insert/")
       :FULL  Type out full documentation to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.
       :SHORT Type out short documentation to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*."
