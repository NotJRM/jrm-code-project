Subject: DEFUN is not a macro
To: bug-lispm@GSI-CAM
Message-Id: <[GSI-ALEX].29-Jun-88 17:23:57.smh>

CLtL says that it is legal for an implementation to implement any
standard CL macro as a special form, but it is required that macro
`equivalent' definitions be provided and that MACROEXPAND use them.  On
the Lambda this just returns the defun, making it impossible for code
walkers to grokkle a defun:

(macroexpand '(defun foo (x) x))

they complain as they should.  However, the message produced is:

This isn't even close.  Actually it should be something like:

A) Meta-X Correct Spelling bombs (because no code bothers to check for

B) The mechanism for invoking the spell checker should do a

   (make-system 'ispell), in case a given site doesn't have
   the needed system files, and also should have an

The lambda compiler should be smart enough to turn MEMBER into MEMQ in
all of the following:

	(member 'foo ...)
	(member ... '(x y z))

Specifically, if the first arg to MEMBER is a constant SYMBOL, or if the
second arg is a constant list of SYMBOLs, then the transformation is
legitimate.  Numbers could be special cased as well, but this is less
frequently useful.

This would improve both lambda and K code speed.

Typing `h' while on the line for file foo.text#n produces:

D foo.text #n+1
D foo.text #n+2
D foo.text #n+3
  foo.text #n+4

but typing `h' while on the line for file foo.text#n+3 produces only:

  foo.text #n
  foo.text #n+1
  foo.text #n+2
D foo.text #n+3
  foo.text #n+4
  foo.text #n+5

and typing `h' while on the line for file foo.text#n+4 or n+5
marks no files for deletion at all.

Perhaps this is correct behavior, but it strikes me as counterintuitive.
Perhaps a particular numeric arg to the `h' command could mean "start
here and delete all the way up to the last two versions of this file."

	:

which exists inside the function ZWEI:DIRECTORY-EDIT-REVERT has an
unfortunate pathological case.  If this code executes as a result of
trying to do a recursive Dired on an empty subdirectory, the user
encounters the following prompt in the minibuffer (note incorrect
punctuation):

"File not found. for <subdirectory>...Pathname to use instead
(default FOO:/lmi/usr/bar), or <End> to enter the debugger:"

At this point, there seems to be no way for the user to say "Forget I
asked," and return to the top level Dired listing gracefully.  Pressing
the <Abort> key leaves a blank screen and an empty Dired buffer (1 line
long, according to COM-LIST-BUFFERS), which is named after the empty
subdirectory (i.e., *Dired-/lmi/usr/-1*). Typing `q' here (which the
mode line promises will exit) generates an ugly error:

	NIL <- DIRED-PROCESS-FILES <- COM-DIRED-EXIT

Pressing the <Abort> key (instead of the `q') brings the user back to
the original Dired buffer, with the cursor on the line representing the
empty subdirectory, and, with the exception of the continued existence
of the useless empty buffer, everything is back to normal.

Well, I've finally managed to squeeze out a list of active
electronic addresses here in Cambridge.  Titles, unfortunately,
are not so clear...

Corbett, Keith		    	keith@gsi-cam

The following lists should prove far more useful; they are the Cambridge
mailing lists for technical issues and questions on Lisp Machines, the
falcon, and documentation.  Info-falcon should be used for questions
about the K/Mac interface.

To: info-lispm@GSI-CAM

New version of Meta-X Kill Or Save Buffers (found in "DJ:SAZ;ZMACS.PATCHES"):

1. Uses up to a full screen of height for buffer menu (as opposed to displaying
   only about 20), thus showing all buffers at once (if possible).
2. Understands numeric argument control-u, which, if passed in, brings up the
   menu with all buffers marked to be killed (after saving, if necessary).

You still must click on "DO IT" in order to cause anything to happen.
Let me know if you like these modifications.

on Alex (LAMBDA):

I did a Source Compare Merge, and after accepting accepting
the second version, when offered a chance to do c-R and edit,
I edited in some stuff.  Then I hit End, and it blew out with
BP's out of order, trying to delete the header.  In fact,
what it did was to delete the entire >>godamned<, buffer from that
point on, thus trashing our entire work in that buffer.

There's a grand tradition of this command being flakey and dangerous,
but it's pretty important that it work, because it's so important to
doing team development.  Can we have a priority on fixing it?  I'll
help if needed.

Thanks.

Symbolics Rel 7 reminds me of one of these fancy expensive American cars that
has a lot of chrome on it and racing stripes and hubcaps that make it
look like you have alloy wheels and a wing on the back that doesn't
actually do anything and retractable headlights and power steering and
power brakes and automatic transmission and an electric sunroof and
power seats and remote-control locks and a little fan that sucks smoke
out of the ashtrays and sheepskin seatcovers and cruise control and a
wiper on the rear window and electric trunk release and a 555 timer to
turn out the inside lights if you forget and cellular car phone
adaptor and a quadrophonic am/fm tape player (with a keypad for
digital presets) and a voice synthesizer that says "Please fasten your
seat belts" and warns you if you are are low on gas or oil or going
too fast and a CB and air conditioning and thermostatic comfort
control (with separate sensors for front and rear seats) and a
dashboard with a lot of little blinky lights and all-digital readouts
(with tachometer! and antifreeze level!) and and and and and

And it doesn't go very fast, because the engine was underpowered to
start with and with all the options it weighs about two and a half
tons, and it has this incredibly sqoodgy suspension so you can't
actually drive it, you sort of more steer it, something like maybe a
twenty-eight foot cabin cruiser, you point it left and it goes left
once it gets round to it, and the microprocessor-controlled brakes are
a trifle hard to get used to because they know much better than you do
how hard you actually want to brake, and the remote-control locks tend
to freeze up at unopportune moments, and you sort of can't help the
fact that the sunroof opens whenever you use the lighter (someone
thought it was a feature, and they now admit it was a mistake, so it
will be fixed in next year's model) and the controls for the power
windows are so hairy it's easier just to leave them up and use the air
conditioning (or light a cigarette to get the roof open).

[forwarded from Connectionists digest - MTG]

                               SEMINAR

                    The Connectionist Air Guitar:
                         A Dream Come True

                        Garrison W. Cottrell
                      Department of Air Science
        Condominium Community College of Southern California

       A major problem faced by many Cognitive Scientists has  been
  the latent desire to be a rock'n'roll star, without the requisite
  talent[1].  Recent advances in connectionist learning  mechanisms
  (Sutton,  1987) have obviated this need.  In this work we present
  the design for the connectionist air guitar[2] -  the  first  air
  guitar to actually produce the notes played.

       This work was motivated by the observation that  it  is  not
  hard  for  people  to  play the songs of their favorite groups on
  their internal phonograph[3] (Kosslyn, 1977).  Thus  the  problem
  may simply be one of poor mapping hardware.  This  suggests  that
  augmentation  by  cognitive models may be useful.  PDP models are
  the  obvious  candidate  for  this  task,  given  that  they  are
  "neurally-inspired", or "brain-like"[4].  In this talk we present
  the first true augmentation of the mind by a connectionist model,
  called Neuro-Acoustic Programming.

       We use a  three-layer  system  as  follows:  Electrodes  are
  placed  on  the  subject's  scalp  using  the International 10-20
  system and amplified by Grass 7P511 preamplifiers[5].  These  are
  the  inputs  to  the  hidden units.  The output layer is simply a
  localist representation of the notes.  These are then  interfaced
  with a standard guitar synthesizer.

       In training, the subject listens to Springsteen  while  "air
  guitaring"  the lead.  The EEG drives the network, resulting in a
  set of outputs.  This result is  then  compared  to  the  correct
  output  (the  music  teacher  signal)  at  small  delta t's using
  Sutton's temporal difference method, and  the  errors  are  back-
  propagated  in  the  usual  way.   After  two albums, the network
  learns to produce the desired notes from the EEG.  Of  note  here
  is  that  the  hidden units develop a distributed encoding of the
  qualia of the notes, including coarsely-coded features sufficient
  to distinguish Jerry  Garcia  from  Conway  Twitty[6].   However,
  myogram  noise  in the EEG often leads to noise in the output, so
  it appears necessary to  implant  arrays  of  silicon  electrodes
  (developed  by  Jim  Bower at CalTech) directly into the temporal
  lobes, eliminating interference from  muscle  signals.   In  this
  case, the network must actually be borne to run.

  ____________________

     [1]One approach is to ignore this  and  form  a  band  anyway.
  People who took this tack started the punk movement.
     [2]An  air guitar is a conceptual representation of a guitar,
  played in synchrony with actual music.  A cult has formed  around
  this  endeavor,  with many contests currently being held in local
  bars.
     [3]Some  people  claim that they actually can't play the songs
  internally as well as they hear them.  This is the "bad cognitive
  needle"  problem,  or,  in  the  case  of Kosslyn's more advanced
  internal cassette player model, "air heads." As long as the  sig-
  nal  uniquely  specifies  the  song,  it  still maps to the right
  notes, so this technique is useful for the hard of thinking.
     [4]This  is  to  be  contrasted  with  "neurally-expired",  or
  "brain-dead" models.
     [5]Other types of Grass amplifiers produce  a  more  "sixties-
  like" sound.
     [6]Some hidden units convert six into nine, the so-called Jimi
  Hendrix units (Easy Rider, 1969).

These are not really nits you're picking.  But I can only say
that I feel I implemented Common Lisp Mode correctly.  It's
different from LISP mode, in that it makes an assumption about
the readtable; the confirmation is there to ask whether you want
to make the change "permanent", i.e. for the file.

As to the dash printed by Set Base, well, it was a matter of (poor)
taste.  I think I thought (?) that the "-" would precede the following
message on the same line.  So I just fixed it, and terminated that
message with a ".", which seems like the right thing.

"Thank you for your support."

Re: message below.

Sounds like a major rewrite is in order.

I think Control-R should be continuable; that is, after editing some stuff,
I usually want to go back to Source Compare Merge.

This could be implemented nicely with a command I've thought of creating
(maybe it exists?) which would let you edit one S-expression in an
auxiliary buffer.  This command (Edit Expression? Edit Thing?) would be
"smart" about the type of thing you're editing.  For instance, it would
indentify after editing a list form; strings would be entered as data,
without having to worry about escapes, and get fixed before being put
into the buffer.

Anyway, I suspect this is a fairly big job, and my only priority right
now is in getting rel 4 out the door.  *Then* we can tackle jobs in
priority order of internal need...

Killing off your last buffer places you in a new, empty buffer called

integer found in the name of a buffer named *Buffer-m* before the
last buffer was killed off.

All this is well and good; however, in this case ^X^F should probably
not default to "*Buffer-n*.lisp" when asked to do a find-file.

I've created SYS:SYS;K-SYSDEF, which is a modified SYS:SYS;SYSDEF
hacked to eliminate various non-Falcon code.  I also made it load
the cross compiler.

In JB:JIM;QCFILE-CHANGES I've added the :FOR-FALCON keyword to
MAKE-SYSTEM.  When cross-compiling it will skip loading the compiled
files.  (Actually, it will sometimes say it is loading them, but it's
really just the null operation.  It's too hard to make MAKE-SYSTEM say
anything conditional).

I defined the :FAZL canonical pathname type to be the Falcon equivalent of
QFASL.

I compiled DEFSEL (the first file to be loaded) and most of the cross compiler
using the cross compiler.  (There's a problem with a hairy combo of unwind-protect's,
special variables, and multiple-value-prog1's that needs to be investigating that
keeps it from getting past QCFASD).

I discovered that in this world, PRIMS:BYTE, PRIMS:BYTE-SIZE, and PRIMS:BYTE-WIDTH
were running interpreted!  Bletch!

This depends on various fixes in the split-up files derived from CROSS-NP2,
so if you're still using CROSS-NP2 you won't win as much.

The pseudo-bug (actually, an auto- or self-reported pseudo-bug) noted
below is fixed:

    2. You can't compile explicit references to host objects via the
    printable form. Looking at the error message, it would be nice to have a
    reconstruction form for host objects.  That is, when compiling a
    reference such as #FS:UNIX-HOST "GSI-CAM", the proper reconstruction
    is as noted above, (SI:PARSE-HOST "GSI-CAM").

While choosing the top left corner of a new window (being created from
the system menu), I suddenly got a pop-up window from a background
process requesting typein (Yes or No). The System Menu process refused
to relinquish control of the mouse, and I had to finish creating the
window before I could mouse the pop up window and type in my response.
Inhibit exposure of background windows until they can be attended to.

Also, in attempting to reproduce this behavior, I discover in addition
that after clicking to place the top left corner (which as we all know
turns the mouse immediately into a bottom-right corner choosing icon),
one had better not switch system programs (e.g., System-P) before
clicking to place that other corner!  (The mouse remains a lower-right
corner icon in the new frame, and the icon representing the upper left
corner remains visible).

2. Install the macro on Hyper-Super-Meta-Control-A.
3. Make a second keyboard macro in the same way as in 1.
4. Install this macro on Hyper-Super-Meta-Control-B.
5. Now make a third keyboard macro with the same mechanism, one which

Hyper-Super-Meta-Control-C (actually) performed.

In fact, that's just what happened, due to Jim's (uninstalled) patch

byte-size 8.  I'm currently working on that.  I presume you've restored
and recompiled all the patches you revoked, no?  I can't do it until
Jim & I get his QFASL changes working right again.

(fs:file-properties "sys:sys;sysdcl  ") returned something new the
other day -- the file properties on "sys:sys;sysdcl.fazl", a new K-fasl
file.

This happened to me on a rather esoteric MAKE-SYSTEM call, and I could
not reproduce it in that way again.

On further investigation I noted that in this case FS:FILE-PROPERTIES
got a list of files with their associated properties, and the .FAZL file
just happened to be the first in the list.  I'm not sure what file
properties on a generic pathname <mean> exactly, but this seems bogus --
perhaps the pathname could be sent :SOURCE-PATHNAME to get a real
pathname to use (namely, the .LISP file)?

By the way, this is an example of how something as innocuous as creating
a new file type can screw the system...

    On the lambda evaluate (ASIN 2).  The imaginary part of the

    Do the PICON people know??



I believe they do know about this -- ASIN's brokenness was an LMI

System 125 is the forever-forked, non-K-machine-softwared,
patchable-on-customer-demand system level.

System 126 was compiled a few days ago, and is actively being patched.
This is the system all K development and K<>Lambda integration should be
happening in.

Please do one of the following next chance you get:

a) run (make-system 'system) and save your own band, or
b) copy a band from DJ, after we put one there, sometime today.

Thanks...
