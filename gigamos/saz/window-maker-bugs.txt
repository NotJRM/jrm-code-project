General Bugs with Window Maker:

1. Windows that have been subdivided into little tiny pieces
become non-mouse-sensitive, thus eliminating any chance of
killing them or expanding them (unless a neighbor happens to be
mouse-sensitive).  Window Maker needs a better way of handling
this.

2. Window Maker needs a way to subdivide panes into
:EVEN subpanes in groups greater than two.

3. Terminal-<Clear Screen> erases everything; no way to get it
back (short of mousing on Reset and starting all over again!)

4. Window Maker HELP window uses a MENU to display text only; the
who-line reads "Menu Choose" as you read the text, and the cursor
changes into the menu chooser, "x", as well.  No mouse input is accepted
at this time, of course; worse, the only way of making the help window
go away is by moving the mouse off of it (a la dynamic menus).

5. There is no way to create more than one pane in a single "Split"
operation; Ideally, Window Maker should enforce the constraint
(recommended in the Window System Manual) that the final pane always use
the :EVEN constraint.  This would be implementable using the following
algorithm: Keep querying the user for more pane split specifications
until he clicks on the "Or (sic) let it use any remaining space" option.
(If user attempts to indicate rightmost/lowest boundary by dragging the
cursor all the way to the right/bottom, Window Maker should throw the
:EVEN keyword, assuming that the user is done Splitting.)

************************************************************************
The following bugs/suggestions all deal with the splitting panes when
the "AREAS OF ABSOLUTE SIZE" option has been selected.  Unless specified
otherwise, all bugs/suggestions occur when specifying window split
points either by LINES or by CHARACTERS (in other words, making vertical
or horizontal splits):

6. When attempting to specify that all remaining space be used for the
second of the two windows (by explicitly moving the mouse to the
furthest right or lowermost character/line location possible), Window
Maker draws the final edge improperly.  The only way to get proper edge
drawing is to specify the :EVEN constraint, using the "Or (sic) let it use
any remaining space" menu option.  This is arguably the "best" way to
achieve this goal anyway, but the user shouldn't observe incorrect
behavior when using a supposedly equivalent mechanism for window
splitting.

7. The user is allowed to specify the furthest right or lowermost item
as the boundary of the FIRST pane, leaving no room anywhere for the
second one to go!  This generates an error, in a background window, when
the user has finished "placing" the second window.

8.  The semantics of specifying the :EVEN constraint (using the "Or let
it use any remaining space") as a response to the "SPECIFY SIZE FOR
FIRST PANE IN" menu are not clear.  It turns out that Window Maker
interprets this response for a first pane border to mean "Start the
second window from the right (or at the bottom) as specified, then use
any remaining space on the left (at the top) to complete the split.
If this is considered desirous behavior, the first pane menu should
read, "Specify dimension of subsequent panes only, and use any remaining
space for this left-most(/top-most) pane."  Note the use of the plural
above, indicating a hope that the splitting command might be extended to
allow the user to create more than three panes at a time out of a larger
one (see next bug).

9. The Absolute Size option enforces a three pane maximum on splits.
Window Maker should continue to allow the user to specify boundaries for
further panes until he has specified he is finished doing so by clicking
on the "Let it use any remaining space" menu item.

10. After specifying the first split point in an "Absolute Size" pane
split sequence, Window Maker should draw a light (or dashed) line where
the window boundary will exist after the split has been performed.  It
is a severe inconvenience trying to figure out where to put the next
boundary without a reference point for the previous one.

************************************************************************

11. Menus with titles have an annoying tendency to interpret deexposing
mouse movements as clicks.  That is, if the mouse is moved off of a menu
which is attempting to determine a splitting mode, a selection gets
made.  This is obviously not what the user means when he moves off of a
menu!

12. When done splitting the panes up, the user is presented with a
barrage of menus which suffer from major sizing and semantical problems.
For instance, aborting from these menus is handled improperly.
