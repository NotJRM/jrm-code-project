;;;Feature: Reads in all files currently without zmacs buffers in the
;;;background after accepting tag table name as unique.  Alerts when
;;;done.
;;;
;;;Feature: Allows specification of identical sets of files for multiple
;;;tag tables (as long as they are given different names).
;;;
;;;Caveat (not specific to this code): Tag table names are not case sensi-
;;;tive!
;;;
;;;Warning: Full defaulting is in effect here, so all versions of a file are used
;;;if you do not specify otherwise!
