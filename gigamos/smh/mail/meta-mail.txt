There is a new mail distribution list for bug reports (etc.)
about the Falcon compiler:  bug-falcon-compiler

Subject: How to add the destination for Falcon "bug" mail to ZMail

Message-ID: <[GSI-GLASS].16-Jun-88 11:00:48.keith>

In LMI Experimental System 124.61, Experimental Local-File 74.2,
Experimental File-Server 23.1, Experimental Unix-Interface 12.0,
Experimental ZMail 72.0, Experimental Tape 23.6,
Experimental Lambda-Diag 16.2, microcode 1759, SDU Boot Tape 3.14,
SDU ROM 103, on Breaking Glass (LAMBDA):

You can add new, non-standard bug mailing list names to ZMail.  For
example, to add the destination for Falcon "bug" mail, I do this in my
ZMAIL.INIT file:


(pushnew '("FALCON"
            :value "FALCON"
            :documentation "Report an issue for the Falcon development group")
         zwei:*zmail-bug-list*
         :key #'car
         :test #'string-equal)

This adds "FALCON" as a choice on the bug mail destination list in
ZMail.  Other BUG-FALCON users may want to do the same.

In response to a query from one of our readers, we poked around in
/usr/lib/aliases to see which mailing lists point to "log" files
and which do not.  The following list summarizes our findings:

MAILING-LIST            LOG FILE STATUS
---------------------------------------------------------
info-falcon:            (none)
bug-falcon:             kept in /lmi/bugs/bug-falcon
bug-falcon-compiler:    kept in /lmi/bugs/bug-falcon-compiler
bug-fleabit-compiler:   kept in /lmi/bugs/bug-falcon-compiler

info-lispm              (none)
bug-lispm:              kept in /lmi/bugs/bug-lispm
doc-changes:            kept in /lmi/doc/mail/doc-changes
technical-staff:        kept in /lmi/doc/technical-staff
---------------------------------------------------------

Our experts tell us that the "info-" style lists are
not archived intentionally, for reasons of disk space
conservation.
