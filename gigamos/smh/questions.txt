This is a list of issues which are not already obvious task items. They
either require study or information which we do not yet have.

KEY: To what project periods is the issue relevant?

      Hardware:
        *H0: Development (Immediate)
        *H1: Board-level processor
        *H2: First-generation chip processor
        *H3: Second-generation chip processor
        *H4: Future generations or applications
      Software:
        *S0: Alpha -- (immediate) support of development
        *S1: Beta release
        *S2: Release 1
        *S3: Release 1.5 (tuning)
        *S4: Release 2

I1. Physical site maintenance and support.
  I1a. Air conditioning. *H0
  I1b. Clean up machine room cabling. *H0
  I1c. Partitions. *H0

I2. K memory: static column vs page mode. *H0*H1*H2
