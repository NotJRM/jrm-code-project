@chapter Notation Conventions

This chapter summarizes the notation conventions used in the manual.


@section Numbers

Hexadecimal quantities are preceded by "#x".

The contents of bit fields are always written in binary, without any
qualifier.

All other numerical quantities are written in base ten.


@section Bit Fields

@tex
The bits of an $N$-bit word are numbered from 0 (the least significant
bit) to $N-1$ (the most significant bit).
@end tex

Bit fields are written in the form MSB:LSB, where MSB (written in base
ten) is the number of the most significant bit in the field and LSB
(also written in base ten) is the number of the least significant bit in
the field.
