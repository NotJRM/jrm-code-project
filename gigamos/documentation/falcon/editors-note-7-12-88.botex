@b[5.3.1.3 The OPEN-ACTIVE-RETURN Destination]
@sp 1

This destination actually loads a set of registers that will be loaded
into OPEN, ACTIVE, and RETURN at the end of the next clock tick.  This
extra step means that these registers take one tick longer than most
other functional destinations to load.  Therefore, the modified frame
pointers should not be used to read data until at least five ticks after
the write instruction (for all CH- operations other than CH-NOOP).
CH-NOOP and all functional sources require only four ticks between read
and write operations.

After modifying the OPEN-ACTIVE-RETURN destination, four clock cycles
are required before using the O, A, or R register frames or using the
OPEN-ACTIVE-RETURN functional source.  Five clock cycles are required
before performing any open, call, or return operations.

@example

     Modifying the OPEN-ACTIVE-RETURN Functional Destination

     <write OPEN-ACTIVE-RETURN>
     <NOP>
     <NOP>
     <NOP>
     <Use O, A, or R register frames>
     <perform open, call, or return operations>

@end example

@b[5.3.2 Functional Sources]

Functional sources are decoded during the IR phase of an
instruction, and enabled onto the MFIO bus during the FSRC
phase of a cycle. They are clocked into the RIGHT register
at the end of this cycle.

In general, a functional source that is read/write should not
be read until at least 4 ticks after the register was
written.  This time may differ for functional sources that are
slower than normal, such as OPEN-ACTIVE-RETURN.

@example
     Reading a Functional Source

     <write functional_source>
     <NOP>
     <NOP>
     <NOP>
     <read functional_source>

@b[6.3.4 Instruction Format Field (Bits 60 to 58)]

These three bits, along with the Next PC field (bits 57 to 56) and
the Call Hardware Operation field (bits 50 to 48), determine the
type of the instruction.  The three fields are decoded by PALs to
generate the control signals required for the instruction.  The
instruction types are detailed in the Instructions section below.

@i[Reference to "yellow alert" trap clarified:]
@end group
@sp 2
The free frame heap keeps track of the 256 register frames.  It
maintains (in hardware) a list of which frames are currently in use and
which frames are currently unused.  The heap hardware is also
responsible for causing a ``yellow alert'' trap (by asserting TRAP_STACK_OVF)
whenever the call hardware is about to run out of frames.


However, the hardware is @i[not] responsible for causing a trap when an
@i[underflow] is about to occur.  Instead, it is the responsibility of
the software to set up the call hardware to regain control on underflow.
This is achieved by replacing the Return PC at the base
of the call hardware stack with the PC of a special routine.  This routine will:

@itemize @bullet
@item
regain control when all frames have exited;
@item
read in the top section of the call stack from memory;
@item
branch to the Return PC originally found at the base of the hardware stack.

@end group
@sp 2

This chapter describes each of the 128 opcodes available on the ALU.  (Ref
AMD manual?)

Several abbreviations are used in the following chart.  "L" represents
the left source of the ALU.  "R" represents the right source of the ALU.
"Status" refers to the ALU's internal status register.  "Q" refers to
the ALU's internal Q register.  "Foo:Bar" means the 64-bit quantity
whose high 32 bits come from Foo and whose low 32 bits come from Bar.
All shift instructions which use the Q register use it as the low word.

@b[Notes and Caveats]

1. Not all of the opcodes are implemented in the assembler.  The
relevant files are ORSON: FLEABIT.GENERATE; ASSEM LISP and K-SYS: K;
ALU-OPCODES LISP.

2. There is something funny about the order of the signed multiply
instructions.

3. There is no last-step-signed-multiply instruction.  Consulting the AMD manual would
probably be enlightening.

@center @b[20.7.3 Simple Arrays]

Simple arrays are one dimensional arrays ("vectors") of any of the
allowed array types. They are not adjustable, not displaced, and do not
have fill pointers or leaders. A simple array has data type $$DTP-ARRAY
(001110).  Its pointer field points to a header with data type
$$DTP-ARRAY-HEADER-SINGLE (100010).  Bits 25:21 of the header contain
the array type.  Bits 20:0 of the header indicate the number of elements
in the array.
