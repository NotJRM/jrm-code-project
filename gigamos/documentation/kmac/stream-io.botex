@c Raw disk commands should be similar to FileSystem major commands,
@c and should be used to establish, utilize, and maintain raw disk
@c partitions.  These partitions will be used by LISP for paging,
@c world-loading, and metering.  To the MAC, these partitions might
@c look like large native files.

Multibuffering:
@itemize @bullet
@item Need to pool resources
@item Spec must be inferred from Montreal
@item Mac must maintain consistent state for each buffer.
@item Buffer state transitions from Montreal exist
@end(itemize)

We must support (K/Mac must implement) the methods to SI:BUFFERED-OUTPUT-STREAM-MIXIN:

@itemize @bullet
@item SETUP-NEXT-INPUT-BUFFER
@item SETUP-NEXT-OUTPUT-BUFFER
@item DISCARD-INPUT-BUFFER
@item DISCARD-CURRENT-OUTPUT-BUFFER
@item SEND-OUTPUT-BUFFER
@item (SET-BUFFER-POINTER?)
@end(itemize)

@center Montreal notes:

Buffer lengths should be device dependent, Lisp-controlled; Lisp feeds
in the information as needed.
