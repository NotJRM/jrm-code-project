Logical pathnames can be specified using either of two ways of delimiting
subdirectories.
Both `.' and `;' may now be used to separate the parent
directory field from the subdirectory field in a pathname.
For example,
the following two pathnames are equivalent:

@lisp
;;Traditional syntax:

(pathname "SYS:MY-DIRECTORY;MY-SUBDIRECTORY;MY-FILE.LISP")

;;;Extended (LISPM-like) syntax:

(pathname "SYS:MY-DIRECTORY.MY-SUBDIRECTORY;MY-FILE.LISP")
@end(lisp)

The @l(UNIX-PATHNAME) flavor now handles a Unix @l(:root) (top-level) directory specification correctly.
As a result, a directory
listing of a Unix system's root directory now returns the correct results.

When the Lambda File Server got a Disk Full error, the user was simply
left hanging.  Now an error is signalled with useful proceed
options, including: running Dired, calling @l(ZWEI:CLEAN-DIRECTORY),
or expunging the directory.

File attribute lists containing @l("Mode:CommonLISP") and/or @l("Syntax:CL")
are now accepted by the compiler, loader, and ZMacs.
Specifying either or both of these attributes is equivalent
to specifying @l("Mode:LISP") and @l("Readtable:CL"),
which provides the correct attributes for CommonLISP code.
