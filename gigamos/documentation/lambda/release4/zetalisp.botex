Named-structure arrays without leaders must be one-dimensional arrays;
if not, an appropriate error is signalled. For example:

@lisp
(make-array '(3 10) :named-structure-symbol :foo)
>>ERROR: Keyword arg keyword :NAMED-STRUCTURE-SYMBOL unrecognized.
  :
@end(lisp)

The function @l(DESCRIBE-FLAVOR) now prints out all the flavors directly depended upon by the argument flavor.

The interactive function @l(FQUERY) has been enhanced in several ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item If a :timeout interval is specified, and no input
is received within the specified interval, @l(FQUERY) prints out the default
choice and the words "timed out".

@item In addition, large :timeout intervals are now printed out using
English phrases for time intervals. For example:

@lisp
(fquery `(:timeout ,(* 60. 864000)) "Do it now? ")
Do it now? (Y or N) (Automatic default after 1 week 3 days, N)
@end(lisp)

This will be seen whenever a function making use of @l(FQUERY)'s :timeout
feature is used (for example, @l(Y-OR-N-P-WITH-TIMEOUT)).

@item If the @l(:TYPE) keyword is given @l(:TYI) as an argument, then the user
may type @clrscrn to clear the screen and reprompt before specifying
an answer.

@end(itemize)
