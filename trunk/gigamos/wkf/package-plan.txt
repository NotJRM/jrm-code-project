
ISSUES:

        Two symbols on lambda => one symbol on K    (ie cons)

        NEW-FASD function which does not use home package always.
          (Needed to deal with map of duplicate to single symbols)

        Some Symbols are in packages via import not inheritance.

METHOD:

        Lambda must guarantee that where duplicate symbols exist on Lambda
          which are one and the same on the K, the two on the lambda must
          have home in GLOBAL and PRIMITIVES.

        NEW-FASD must guarantee that when it sees a symbol with home GLOBAL,
          if a symbol with that name is in PRIMITIVES Pass to the k
          'prims:symbol-name.

        Explicily import symbols on k as it is done in package-definitions
          for the lambda.  Later we will need to also Do as in the lambda
          cold-load imports in order to port the lambda code.
