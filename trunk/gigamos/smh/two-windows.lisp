;;; Trivially modified version of TWO-WINDOWS: takes two windows
;;; (structures, not sheets) and makes them share the area
;;; originally occupied by the first of the two, except that
;;; this version makes two side-by-side VERTICAL windows
;;; rather than one on top of the other.  Very nice for text
;;; editing (with narrow fill columns).
