;;; The edit history is a series of formatted textual entries located at the end
;;; of the source file.  The history is seperated by the EDIT-HISTORY-MARKER,
;;; followed by a header identifying the name of the file, etc.
;;; Each entry then begins with an EDIT-HISTORY-BEGIN, followed by an entry header
;;; the associated commentary, and then the EDIT-HISTORY-END characters if any.


;;; Each major mode defines comment markers for use in the edit history.
