; Here's some documentation of the Lambda's primitives for character drawing.
;
; (TV:DRAW-CHAR FONT CHAR X Y ALU SHEET-OR-ARRAY)
;       Draws the character with code CHAR in FONT with its upper left corner at
;       position (X,Y) in outside coordinates.  ALU is used as the ALU function,
;       so you can either draw or erase.  There is no clipping or error checking.
;
; (SYS:%DRAW-CHAR FONT CHAR X Y ALU SHEET-OR-ARRAY)
;       This is the actual microcoded primitive.  It does not take into account the
;       indexing table of a wide font, so when used on a wide font CHAR is not the
;       character code that the user actually wants to output.
;       It is best to use TV:DRAW-CHAR.
;
; (SYS:%DRAW-LINE X0 Y0 X Y ALU DRAW-END-POINT-P SHEET-OR-ARRAY)
;       Draws a line from (X0,Y0) to (X,Y) all relative to the outside edges of the
;       sheet, or indices in the array.  The point at (X,Y) is not drawn if
;       DRAW-END-POINT-P is NIL.  No clipping or error checking is done.
;
; (SYS:%DRAW-RECTANGLE WIDTH HEIGHT X-BITPOS Y-BITPOS ALU-FUNCTION SHEET-OR-ARRAY)
;       Draws a rectangle of size WIDTH by HEIGHT with its upper left corner at
;       (X-BITPOS,Y-BITPOS). You can draw, erase, or complement the rectangle.
;       There is no clipping or error checking.
