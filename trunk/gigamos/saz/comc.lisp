  "Compile or evaluate a part of the current buffer.
COMPILE-P is T to compile, NIL to eval, or else a function to evaluate and print a form.
If there is a region, it is used; otherwise the current or following defun is used.
USE-TYPEOUT is passed to COMPILE-PRINT-INTERVAL and controls where information is printed.
DEFVAR-HACK says always re-set variables if DEFVARs are evaluated.
 Normally this is only done if there is no region.
MODE-NAME is a string containing a capitalized present participle, such as /"Compiling/".
ECHO-NAME is a string containing a lowercase past participle and period (/"compiled./")."
