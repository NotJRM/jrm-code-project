                  MAKING COLD LOAD BANDS FOR THE LAMBDA

"Deep down within the warm exterior of the Lisp Machine lurks a cold
load stream."                             --pld (possibly misquoted)

Prerequisites:

        1) A 2x2 processor'ed Lambda with two monitors.

        2) An available partition on the Lambda for which
           the new band is being made.  This partition should
           be no smaller than 12000 pages of virtual memory.

        3) Approximately three hours.

Procedure:

        The first part of this exercise requires typein to the first
monitor.

FROM MONITOR 1:
************************************************************************

Instructions:                           Notes:

1. Fix all bugs, add
     desired patches,
     recompile any
     systems that need
     recompiling

2. Do a full garbage collection.

3. (si:describe-partitions)             Find a partition
                                        of proper size in
                                        the typeout from
                                        (si:describe-partitions).
                                        Call it "LODx" (x will
                                        be an integer, though).

4. (make-system 'cold :noconfirm)
                                        Makes a bootable band
                                        from which to create
                                        a new world.  The file
                                        "sys:sys;sysdcl" contains
                                        the names of all files
                                        which will be loaded at
                                        this time. Changing any
                                        of these files (or any of
                                        the files in
                                        INNER-SYSTEM-FILE-ALIST)
                                        would necessitate the
                                        creation of a new cold load
                                        band.  Commenting any of
                                        these files out (as has been
                                        done to a good number of
                                        them already) causes them
                                        not to be included in the
                                        initialized world.  Know the
                                        ramifications of excluding all
                                        basic systems before
                                        commenting out anything in
                                        this sysdcl list.

5. (cold:make-cold "LODx")
                                        Requires confirmation.
                                        Calls, among many other
                                        things, LISP-REINITIALIZE.
                                        The function QLD (also
                                        called here) loads all of
                                        INNER-SYSTEM-FILE-ALIST,
                                        which reinitializes the error
                                        and trap handlers, format
                                        and other basic I/O systems,
                                        networks, and prepares for a
                                        disk-save. (Note: check out
                                        the functionality of
                                        ANALYZE-FILE in L.SYS2.)
                                        Make-cold also gets the time
                                        from the primary server, or,
                                        failing there, queries the
                                        user for a valid time.  Entire
                                        evaluation should take
                                        approximately 25 minutes.

6. Run a cold load server by typing <System>-7.

                                        The first monitor will divide
                                        into two windows, one called
                                        "LAM" and one called "Mini
                                        Server Window". LAM
                                        checks the virtual address
                                        space of the other processor,
                                        and the Mini Server will run
                                        a process that listens to the
                                        backplane.

7. In the Mini Server Window, type (mini-server-process).

The remainder of this exercise requires typein to the second monitor.

************************************************************************
FROM MONITOR 2:
************************************************************************

8. Type c-m-c-m-<LINE>                  Going to the cold load stream.

9.  COMMAND: set-band LODx

10. COMMAND: boot                       Boots from the new cold load
                                        band, coming up containing
                                        only a cold load stream.

11. Wait.  If the second monitor's run bar stops blinking for an exten-
    ded period, continue to wait.

12. Evaluate (si:qld)                   Very carefully. Typing
                                        anything other than these 8
                                        tokens will cause massive
                                        destruction of all work done
                                        to this point, as the new cold
                                        load band contains NO error
                                        handling or microcode
                                        trap handling capabilities
                                        whatsoever.

13. Wait some more (approximately 1 hour this time).

Tools For Use In A Typical Crash
************************************************************************

A typical crash will usually occur because of the inability of the
bare-bones cold-load stream to cope with an unbound variable it has
encountered.  In this case, the following is a list of tools usable from
the place where you wind up.

Input Command                   Functionality

:stkp                           shows stack, pointer
:relpc                          FEF and relative offset
:md/                            DTP null, shows the thing trapped upon
:md/ _s                         prints it as a lisp object
usp/                            microcode stack pointer
:atom *foo*                     (*foo* a symbol) Calls (describe *foo*)
                                   in otherworld
opu                             top of stack
lpu                             next call
