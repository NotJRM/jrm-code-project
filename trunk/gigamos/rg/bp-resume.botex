@b(PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE)

  Richard D. Greenblatt is a recognized pioneer in Artificial
Intelligence. He has been President of GigaMOS Systems Inc.
since its founding in June, 1987.   Previous to that he
served as Vice president and Technical Director
of Lisp Machine Inc. since its founding in 1980.  Prior to that,
he was a Principal Research Scientist working at the
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, having been a principle figure at
the lab during the period 1966 to 1981.

  Mr Greenblatt has originated and carried forward a number of
notable projects including the following:

  The Moby Address Scheme, which allows the implementation of
extraordinarily large address spaces, and underlies a set of
solutions to a wide variety of management problems for very
large databases.  This scheme is the subject of a currently
pending patent application.

  Designer of the Lambda processor.   Extensive responsibility
supervising design and implementation of hardware and software.

  Originator and head  of LISP Machine project at the MIT AI Lab.
Started project in 1973 and was the only person working on it for
a year thereafter.

  Author of the Greenblatt chess program.  This was the first computer
chess program to achieve a level of play beyond that of a rank
beginner.  It was the first chess program to play in a human
tournament and the first to win a tournament chess game.  This program
beat Hubert Dryfus, a prominent critic of AI, in a publicized chess
game in 1967.

Some other projects with which he as been associated include the
following, in chronological order, starting with work initiated in the
1960s:

  The MIDAS Symbolic Assembler.  He designed and implemented the MIDAS
symbolic assembler for the PDP-10.

  PDP-6 TECO.  He was an implementor of the original PDP-6 TECO editor.
This system has been developed by others into the EMACS editor which is
currently in use in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the
Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) and in many other sites.

  The ITS Timesharing System. He was a principle author of the
timesharing system that formed the nucleus of the computational
facilities for the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Laboratory
for Computer Science during the period 1966 to 1982.  It is still in use
at the lab today.

  The PDP-10 MACLISP System.  He was co-author of the original PDP-10
MACLISP compiler, which pioneered many new techniques in LISP compilers.

   The CHEOPS Chess Processor.  He supervised the design and
construction of the CHEOPS special-purpose chess processor, which can
examine more than 100,000 chess positions per second.  He wrote all the
software for CHEOPS, including the microassembler and debugger as well
as the actual chess-playing software itself.

   The Convolution Box.  He wrote the initial software for the
convolution box, a special-purpose attachment to the LISP
Machine for performing the convolution of images used in
computer vision research.  This was the earliest special purpose
hardware used by Marr's vision group at MIT.

   Principal consultant to the LOGO project at the MIT Artificial Intelligence
Labortory during the late sixties and early seventies.  This project was headed
by Seymour Papert and developed the LOGO computer language for elementary school
children, which is widely available today.

@b(CURRENT RESEARCH)

   Mr. Greenblatt has active research interests in a number of areas.
His active projects include a semantic memory and concept forming
system, and system for learning coordination of multiple joints in a
computer controlled robotic system.

@b(PERSONAL)

     Richard D. Greenblatt, born December 25, 1944, graduated from
Hickman High School in Columbia, Missouri, in 1962.  He attended the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate from September
1962 to December 1965 and from December 1966 to June 1967.
Subsequently, he was admitted as a graduate student, and attended from
January 1970 to June 1971.  He did not, however, receive any degrees,
choosing instead to concentrate on his research.
