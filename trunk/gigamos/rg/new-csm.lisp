;a CSM program is expressed in the form of BLOCKS and STATEMENTS.

;a BLOCK represents 16 consecutive statements stored at a multiple of 16 boundary.
; the block is intended for use with a particular one of the 8 one-of-16 next address
; selection possibilities of the CSM state machine.  Each BLOCK as a symbolic name which
; is a LISP symbol.  The BLOCK is specified by giving its name, the condition to be tested,
; and the symbolic names of the 16 codewords of the block.

;a STATEMENT specifies a CSM codeword.  A next condition is also specified which can
; be either a BLOCK, or another statement.

;Each statement specifies whether it is allowable for a "foreign" NUBUS write to occur
; during this cycle.  If so, an "call" to the verification subroutine is loaded in
; the "mirror" image, if not, a transfer to CACHE-VALIDATION-ERROR.

;timing note:  cache.request L is initially asserted by memory.start.this.UINST,
;  so the READ-REQUEST or WRITE-REQUEST codewords are fetched during the source cycle
;  of the UINST following ((xxx-start-xxx) ..), which is normally (and will be referred to)
;  as the CALL-CONDITIONAL.  Thus, READ-REQUEST, for example, appears  in the CSMREG
;  at the beginning of the execute cycle of the CALL-CONDITIONAL.  The first level
;  map was also "started" during the source cycle of the CALL-CONDITIONAL, and thus is
;  "valid" when READ-REQUEST appears in CSMREG.  The second level map, however, (which is
;  the one that really matters), has just started fetching when READ-REQUEST is in CSMREG
;  and is NOT valid.  However, READ-REQUEST causes cache to fetch anyway, so that
;  at the end of READ-REQUEST, a grand and glorious multiway branch can be made.

;the cache validation feature:

;Thus, if a write cycle starts on the bus when we are not master, NUBUS.WRITE.STARTING L
;will assert.  The address gets captured in the NUADR register (since that loads
;on every NUBUS address.sampletime.)  The timing looks like this:

;S0                                                     (start cycle on bus)
;C0     start synced, NUADRnn strobed
;S1     random codeword RC1 strobed
;       CSMRAM accesses                                 (write data on bus)
;C1     validation test codeword strobed into CSMREG
;S2     CACHE.read to test for data going stale         (ACK traveling back on bus)
;C2     validation correct codeword strobed into CSMREG
;       CACHE.hit strobed into CACHE.hit.synced
;S3     CACHE.write to invalidate stale data            (soonest possible next start cycle.)
;        (if CACHE.hit.synced)
;C3     soonest time NUADR could be restrobed.  This clock would be C0 for following write
