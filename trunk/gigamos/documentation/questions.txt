PAL CHANGES

        Daisy chips -- Falcon
           Simulator by end of week (6/10)

        Daisy boards work but are currently untested.

        K is currently able to reset to a known state.


CURRENT LOWELL STATUS

        problems remaining are with individual bits only
        TRANSMIT works
        RECEIVE works
        Functional pair projected by end of week (6/10)
        Of 20 MacMate units, 5 will go to Lambdas, 15 to Macs
        1 to be boxed/packaged for AAAI-88 -- should be functional,
           transportable, painted.
        Awaiting a "working" prototype (i.e., "one we have faith in")
        6-ft cabling suggested in production
        One 50-ft cable for test purposes
           Rate the chips appropriately
        Memory Received
        Static Column RAMS -- 25 SIMS (none before January)
        Toshiba, Toyocom
        6 full-speed 4 Meg machines (?)

SILICART

        Minor changes required to the K Technical Manual, plus sections
            on Reset, Screen Spy, and Single Stepping

        Timing Simulations: 15 seconds per step
        Logic Simulations: somewhat faster
            (simulating a 16-Meg Lambda using half a 2x2)

DATA TRANSFER RATES

        Driver writes 24-bit addresses

        [Consistent with:
          Mac OS uses 24 bits address, plus eight flag bits = 32
        ?]


GIGATEXT

        French/English translator (?)

MACHINE REGISTER ACTIVITY

        1. Register pool for new and discarded registers, local variables
        2. Important registers:

                Open (K:o0-15)
                Active (K:a0-15)
                Return (K:r0-15)

        3. Commands and issues fleshed out in some detail:

        OPEN (or CH-OPEN)
        CALL
        TAIL-OPEN
        TAIL-CALL
        MULTIPLE VALUES
             31
            destination-return-mv (hardware)

        4. Other issues mentioned:

        DATA FORMATS
        MEMORY AND STORAGE CONVENTIONS
        LOW-LEVEL PROTOCOLS


OTHER SOFTWARE ISSUES

K compiler
 benchmarks
 diagnostics

Bus coupler diagnostics in Cambridge are awaiting arrival
of a bus coupler and initialization code from RWK.  After
both have been produced and tested, they can be shipped to
Montreal for integration there.

TRAPS

Software trap handler decides who gets passed arguments
such as constants, variables, and certain state information.
The software trap handler lives in low-memory on the K, is
written in assembler, and consists of a sequence of
instructions:

A. Save state
B. Determine whether trap is a synchronous or asynchronous one
C. Call the appropriate servicing routine
D. (Once serviced,) return to more trap handler code
