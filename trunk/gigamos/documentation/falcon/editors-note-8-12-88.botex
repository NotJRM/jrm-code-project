This draft of the @b[K Technical Manual] contains the
following revisions (in cases where there are discrepancies in
chapter/section numbers between drafts, those of the current draft are
used).

The visible features of the call hardware include the @i[call stack],
and the @i[free frame heap].

The call stack is used to save and restore processor state during
function call operations. Each entry on the call stack represents, at
least conceptually, the Lisp Machine idea of a stack frame.  When a
function is called, an entry is pushed to save the state of the caller;
when a function returns, an entry is popped to re-establish the state of
the caller.

The free frame heap maintains a hardware list of unused register frames.
The heap hardware is also responsible for causing a ``yellow alert''
trap (by asserting TRAP_STACK_OVF) whenever the call hardware allocates
more than a pre-established number of frames.  This trap is used to
trigger the copying of the call stack to memory; the copied frames are
then available for immediate use.

The hardware does not cause a trap when a call stack
@i[underflow] is about to occur.  Software
must set up the Return PC at the base
of the call hardware stack with the address of a special routine, which
must:

@itemize @bullet
@item
read in the top section of the call stack from memory;
@item
branch to the Return PC of the routine whose frame was found at the base
of the hardware stack.

@b[19.3.2 Bignums]

@tex
Bignums may use up to $2^{18}$ words of storage for a number.
The range of bignums is $-2^{2^{23}}$ to $2^{2^{23}} - 1$.  However, a
bignum may not have a value in the fixnum range ($-2^{23}$ to $2^{23} - 1$).
If the result of a bignum operation lies in that range, it must be converted
to a fixnum.

@b[19.7.4.2 Fill Pointer]

The fill pointer is a fixnum that indicates the number of
words currently used in an array. If present, it is the first
leader word.

@b[19.7.4.4 Leaders ]

If the has leader bit is set then the array has an array leader. The
offset from the main header to the "Number Of Leader Words" word is in the
leader-offset field.
