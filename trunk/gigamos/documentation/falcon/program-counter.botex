@chapter Program Counter

@section Introduction

The Program Counter is a 24-bit quantity.  It addresses the current
instruction being executed.  There is no explicit PC register; instead,
the PC appears at the output of a 4-way multiplexer.  The details are
described in the Hardware section below.


@section Relation of PC to Virtual Addresses

@tex
The 24 bits of PC allow an address space of $2^{24}$
64-bit instructions.  This works out to $2^{25}$ 32-bit words, exactly
half of virtual memory space.  Instructions are only stored in the high
half of virtual memory.

Since there are 32 bits at each virtual address, and an instruction is 64 bits
wide, each value of the PC must correspond to two virtual addresses.  A PC is
converted into a pair of virtual addresses by these formulas:  Address of
low word = $2PC+2^{25}$; Address of high word = $2PC + 2^{25} + 1$.

@section Hardware

This section describes the hardware associated with the Program Counter.


@subsection PC Mux

The PC itself appears as the output of this 4-way, 24-bit multiplexer.

The four sources for the multiplexer are as follows.  (0) PCINC, the
output of the PC incrementer.  (1) The Return PC register from the call
hardware.  (2) OUTREG, the ALU's output register.  (3) Bits 23:0 of the
Instruction Register.


@subsection PC Incrementer (PCINC)
@label[PCINC]

This is a registered 24-bit incrementer.


@subsection Delayed PC Incrementer

This is a 24-bit register.  Its input lines are connected to PCINC; this
effectively delays PCINC for one clock tick.


@subsection Old PC Registers

The last two PC's are kept in a pair of registers.  These PC's are
needed to correctly save and restore the machine state during trap
entry/exit.
