This chapter is an overview of the memory board.

@section Overview


@section Memory Control Register
@label[MCR]

The Memory Control Register (MCR) is a 32-bit register.  Its contents
are used as control lines for various parts of the memory board.  The
MCR may be read or written by accessing functional source/destination
1100010.

All bits in the MCR are zeroed by a reset.

@section Memory Status Register
@label[MSR]

The Memory Status Register (MSR) is a 32-bit register.  It contains
various status bits from the memory board.  The MSR may be read from
functional source 1100110.

@section Memory Board Hardware

The MCR [Memory Board, Page 22] is implemented with four 74LS273
registers.  The four 74LS244 buffers are used for reading the MCR.

The MSR [Memory Board, Page 23] is implemented with four 74LS244
buffers.
