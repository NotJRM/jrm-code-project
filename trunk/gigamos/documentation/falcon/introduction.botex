@chapter Introduction

This is a preliminary draft of the K processor technical manual.  It is
intended to describe the K processor from a system software programmer's
perspective.  It does not dwell on details of the various hardware
implementations.

For a full hardware specification of the processor, consult the
@i[Falcon Processor Design Specification] by Kent Hoult and the actual
board and chip schematics.

Please observe that any documentation or information about the K
processor (including this manual) is proprietary information belonging
