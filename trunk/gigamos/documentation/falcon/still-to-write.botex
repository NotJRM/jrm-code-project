How long must the processor wait after a memory write before it can
perform another memory system operation?

What does the low bit of VMA and MD functional destinations mean?

What registers can return-new-open and return-new-tail-open write in to?
How do the RETURN and RETURN-MV functional destinations work?  Just how
does this all work?

What use is the VMA box bit?

Differences between chip & board set.  Do PCR, PSR, MCR, and MSR all
change?

ALU opcodes.  Sign extend, macro link bit.  See AMD manual.

Write VMA/MD box bit stuff.
