Typing @terminal-@resume, which permits deexposed typeout for a window
that wants to type out, now clears that window's Output Hold flag as
well.

Windows which employ the @l[zwei:*stream-comtab*],
such as Lisp/Edit windows and Lisp Listeners,
now provide @ctrl[c] and @meta[c] as
synonyms for @cm[y] (which redisplays the last entry on the input
history) and @meta[y] (which cycles backwards through the input history).

@cindex[gauges]
The function @l(tv:fancy-landscape) changes the screen layout
to include a column of ``gauges'' -- analog dials --
that maintain a readout of various meters of system activity.
In particular, disk, processor, and network activity can be monitored.

@defun tv:fancy-landscape &optional (enable t)

Set up landscape monitor with gauges.  T to enable, NIL to disable.
@end(defun)

The System Menu has been modified to include an entry called
@mouseditem[Imagen Options].  Clicking on this entry presents the user
with a menu for modifying default Imagen Printer settings.

The function @l[tv:add-system-key] has been changed to prevent
adding a redundant system key definition
(one that is @l(EQUAL) to an existing entry in @l(tv:*system-keys*)).
