@sp 1

Note that three tapes are included in the kit.
The LISP files that were previously provided on one tape (``the sources'')
have been distributed on two tapes for Release 4:

@enumerate

@csubindex[LISP options][tape contents]
@item
The @i(``Release 4 Options Tape'') contains the software systems
that are frequently loaded and used, including:
@include options

@cindex[LISP sources]
@item
The @i(``Release 4 Sources Tape'') contains the @l(".LISP") files that
make up most of the ZetaLISP-Plus@tm@  system software;
these are provided for the users' reference,
to assist in such operations as diagnosis of programming problems.
@end(enumerate)

The system manager should determine from the description above
what tapes need to be restored.
The restoration procedures are described separately, further in this document.

This update kit is all that is required to upgrade a system to Release 4, provided
that the following requirements are met:

@table 3

@cindex[software prerequisites]
@item
PREREQUISITE SOFTWARE -
It is not necessary to load a prior release of LISP software before loading Release 4.
You can update a blank system, or one that has been running Lambda LISP software
(Release 2, 3, or 4) previously.
However, the Lambda @ii[must have been updated with a Release 3 SDU ``boot tape''].

@cindex[boot tape]
The best way to confirm that the system disk has been updated with Release 3 SDU software
is to run the @l(load) command at the SDU.
Use the @l(print) command to inspect the disk label.
The LISP label must be located on cylinder 1.
Verify that there is a partition named @l(UNX6);
this is the partition that contains the Release 3 SDU software.

@b[If the system has not been upgraded with a Release 3 boot tape,]
do not proceed with the installation of Release 4.
For information on upgrading with a boot tape, see the @i(Lambda Operations Manual).

@cindex[backups]
@item
BACKUPS -
Customers who have been running a prior release should make full backups
of their LISP file system(s) and load band(s).
The procedure for performing full backups is documented in the @i(Tape Software Manual).

@item
INSTALLING SOFTWARE ON A BLANK DISK (OR NEW SYSTEM) -
Software installation on a blank disk is performed with the SDU @l(load) program.
See the @i(Lambda Operations Manual) for the complete procedure.
Use the @i(``Release 4 Band/Microcode Tape'') in place of the
Release 3 band tape mentioned in that manual.

@item
FREE DISK PARTITIONS -
Loading the LISP run-time software from the @i(``Release 4 Band/Microcode Tape'') uses up
one of the available load (``LOD'') bands and
two of the microcode (``LMC'') bands on the disk.
Make a backup of any Release 3 load bands that you may need to use in the future.

If you have customized site files, or if you load optional systems,
you will have to save the updated LISP world
to a second load band.
It is possible to @l(disk-save) on top of the current load band, but
this is not recommended.

The procedure for saving a LISP load band is explained in the installation instructions
later in this manual.

@item
FREE FILE SPACE -
A significant quantity of file space is used up when the LISP software
(the options and/or the system sources) is restored.
Select the desired options carefully, and
estimate the amount of file space remaining before proceeding
to load the optional files.

@itemize -
@item The @i(Release 4 LISP Options) files occupy about 9,000 blocks.
@item The @i(Release 4 LISP Sources) files occupy about 12,000 blocks.
@end(itemize)

List a directory on the system host to verify that there
is sufficient free space.
Note the text @l("Free=12010") displayed in the following example:

@smalllisp
(listf "LM:~;")

MASTER: ~; *.*#*
Free=12010, Reserved=10, Used=48000 (12 pages used in )
  :
 OUR-SITE.DIRECTORY  #1   3   DIRECTORY !   05/27/88 13:45:45   pld
 REL.DIRECTORY   #1   1   DIRECTORY !   11/10/86 19:51:02       rel
 TMP.DIRECTORY   #1   5   DIRECTORY !   07/20/88 23:01:51       pld
  :
@end(smalllisp)

In this example, there are 12010 free blocks.
This is enough space to restore all the options, @ii(or) the sources, but not both.

@end(table)

@chapter New Features and Improvements

@enumerate
@item
Various enhancements to the Site Editor have been made
to improve the interface and solve known problems.
@item
The @l(:IMAGEN) printer driver has been enhanced.
See the @i(Lambda Networking Guide) for further information.
@item
Two new (experimental) Tape system formats, ``TANALYZ-FORMAT'' and ``TAR-FORMAT'',
have been implemented.
@item
The Kermit window has been enhanced, and
known problems with the SDU serial ports have been resolved.@cindex[Kermit]
@item
Various enhancements to the Window-Maker have been made
to improve the interface and solve known problems.@cindex[Window-Maker]
@end(enumerate)

Some of these improvements are discussed further, below.

@need 1200
@subsection Site Editor

The Site Editor is not loaded in the default band;
it can be restored and loaded from the @i(``Release 4 Options Tape'') (see below).

Once it is installed,
the Site Editor can be invoked by executing @l[(sited:sited)],
or by pressing @syson[@gkey-E].

@cindex[site editor]
The major Site Editor commands are now grouped under logical headings.
This new configuration is invoked by default, but the wide-area
configuration that was provided in Release 3 is still available.
Clicking on the menu command @mouseditem(Configure Window)
toggles between the two configurations.

A new command is provided, @mouseditem(Point to Site Files), which
prompts the user for the parameters to execute @l(si:set-sys-host).
Use this function to point to your set of site files.
See the @i(Lambda Networking Guide) for further information
about @l(si:set-sys-host).

@need 1200
@subsection Kermit

@cindex[Kermit]
Kermit is not loaded in the default band;
it can be restored and loaded from the @i(``Release 4 Options Tape'') (see below).

Once it is installed, Kermit can be invoked by pressing @syson[K].

The major Kermit commands are now grouped under logical headings.

Clicking on the menu command @mouseditem(Configure Window)
toggles between two configurations, varying the size of the terminal emulator window.

The command @mouseditem[Serial Port] prompts the user for the parameters
for initializing the serial port.
This is a modified version of the @mouseditem[Set Baud Rate] command in earlier releases.

Serial port ``open forms'' that were not fully implemented have been removed from the command menu.

A new Kermit parameter under @mouseditem[Review Parameters] determines the enabling
of XON/XOFF (software flow control) on the serial port lines.
The option, @l(*sdu-serial-xon-xoff-p*), is enabled by default;
software flow control is commonly used
to connect terminals and personal computers to the Lambda serial ports.

@subsection Spelling Checker

The Spelling Checker may be restored from the @i(``Release 4 Options Tape'')
and installed as the ``ISPELL'' system.
With the spelling checker installed, ZMacs offers a useful command interface.

@cindex[spelling checker]
To check the spelling of a particular word from ZMacs,
position the cursor on or near the word and press @meta[$].

If the word (or its root) is found, a message to this effect
is printed in the ZMacs echo area, along with its derivation, if any.
If the word cannot be found, valid alternatives are listed in the echo area.
To select one of the displayed alternatives, press the corresponding numeric key.
Press @spacekey to leave the word ``as is''.
Press ``R'' to replace the word with text you type in the mini-buffer;
ZMacs will replace the word in the buffer.

@group
The LISP interface function @l(spell:spell-word) is also provided:

@defun spell:spell-word word &optional (start 0) end

The interface to the spelling checker.
@i(word) is a string containing the word to be checked.

The return value can be:
@itemize
@item
The input @i(word): The word was found either in the system dictionary or your private dictionary.
@item Another word: This string, derived by stripping suffixes
from the original word, was found in the system dictionary.
@item A list of words: These strings are words that are ``close''
to the original word.
They are  capitalized like the original word.
@item NIL: Neither the original or any near misses could be found.
@end(itemize)
@end(defun)
@end(group)

@need 1200
@subsection Inspector

INSPECTing an instance and modifying a slot that was not listed
in the Flavor's :settable-instance-variables no longer causes the error,
"The object received a :set ... message which went unclaimed."
The message was accurate, but misleading, as INSPECT
proceeds to set the instance variable by another method.

@need 1200
@subsection New Tape Formats

Two new tape formats have been implemented.
Their purpose and use is explained below.

To invoke the menu-driven interface to the tape software,
press @syson[B].
To select a tape format, click left with the mouse on the current format --
by default, @mouseditem[LMFL-FORMAT] --
displayed under the column marked @i(Selected Format).
This will bring up a menu of supported tape formats;
click to select the desired format.
At this point you may be prompted
to set any options that are specific to the selected tape format.

You can always return to the default @mouseditem(LMFL-FORMAT) by right-clicking
on the currently selected format.

When you use the tape software functions in LISP
(such as @l(tape:list-files)), you can also select a specific tape format
by binding the variable @l(tape:*selected-format*).
Use the function @l(tape:parse-format) to obtain the flavor object
corresponding to a tape format,
and @l(tape:set-format-options) to set options for the selected format.

@defvar tape:*selected-format*
The currently selected tape format.
The binding of this (as a special variable)  affects the behavior
of most tape software functions.
@end(defvar)

@defun tape:parse-format &rest init-options
Takes a format name, flavor-symbol, or format object
and returns a format object initialized according to INIT-OPTIONS.
@end(defun)

@defun tape:set-format-options &optional options &key (format-spec tape:*selected-format*)
Set the options of a particular format.  Options should be a
list of the form ((:<option> <value>) ...) or NIL, in which case
the user may be presented with a menu of options to change.
@end(defun)

@need 1000
For example, to list a @l(TAR) tape, you could execute:

@lisp
(let ((tape:*selected-format*
        (tape:parse-format "TAR")))
  (tape:set-format-options)
  (tape:list-files))
@end(lisp)

See the @i(Tape Software Guide) for further information.

@need 1200
@subsubsection TANALYZ Format

@cindex[tape analyzer]@cindex[TANALYZ (tape format)]
The new TANALYZ tape format is designed solely for
analyzing foreign tapes.
It provides formatted hexadecimal and text displays of the data contained on a tape.
TANALYZ is a ``raw format'', in that it treats a tape as a stream of unformatted data.
Within the constraints of the tape hardware,
TANALYZ should be able to read and display portions of almost any tape,
regardless of its format.
This can be useful in several different ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
To tape software developers (for debugging)
@item
For trouble-shooting tape I/O errors (format processing is bypassed)
@item
For use with utilities such as Unix @l(TAR) or @l(DD), to determine
a tape's logical blocking parameters
@end(itemize)

By examining a TANALYZ tape listing, it is possible to determine the
details of a tape's logical formatting
such as blocking factor, character set, and new-line conventions.

The most useful operation for TANALYZ-FORMAT is @l(:LIST-FILES).
No read/write operations are supported.

@ref[figure-tanalyz], contains an example of the output from the @mouseditem(LIST-TAPE) tape
frame command with TANALYZ-FORMAT selected.
By examining the TANALYZ tape listing, it is possible to determine that the
tape in question was probably formatted with the Unix @l(TAR) utility.

@figure
@setq figure-tanalyz figure-page
@example
@include tanalyz
@end(example)
@sp 1
@caption Example Tape Listing from Tanalyz-Format
@end(figure)

When you select TANALYZ-FORMAT, you will be prompted for two options,
as follows:

@table 1
@item @b(Blocking factor in kilobytes:)
This specifies the  (maximum) physical blocking factor.
The default is 32  (32768 bytes)
which is the maximum physical block size
that the tape device interface can handle.

@item @b(Output Mode:)
Choose either @i(Brief), @i(Verbose), or @i(Full).
These specify increasing levels of detail in the tape listing.

@itemize @bullet
@item Brief mode displays one line of data from the beginning of each file.
@item Verbose mode (the default) displays a hexadecimal and text representation
of the beginning of each tape block.
@item Full mode display is similar to the Verbose display, but
every character in each block is displayed.
@end(itemize)

@end(table)

@need 1200
@subsubsection TAR Format

@cindex[TAR tape format]
TAR Format provides limited capabilities for reading and writing tapes on the Lambda
in a format that is compatible with the System 5 Unix @l(TAR) utility.

Most important tape operations have been implemented, including
@l(list-files), @l(restore-file), @l(compare-file), and @l(write-file).
Tape file streams have not been implemented.

When you select TAR-FORMAT, you will be prompted for its options, as follows:

@table 1

@item Record Size:
Specify the length, in bytes, of each physical tape block.
This must be a multiple of 512, up to a maximum of 10240.
The maximum corresponds to a @l(TAR) blocking factor of 20.

@item Character set translation:
Choose one of @l(determine-by-type), @l(always), @l(query), or @l(never).
This option determines if and when character translations are performed
between LISPM and ASCII formats.

The choice @l(always) indicates that character set translation should
always be performed, on every file.

The choice @l(never) indicates that character set translation should never be performed.

The choice @l(query) indicates that the tape software should query the user
as to whether a file in question contains ASCII characters.

The default, @l(determine-by-type), attempts to translate the file type
for each file to determine if it is a binary file.
Otherwise, it is assumed that each file is text, and character translations are performed.
The known binary file types are listed in the following variable:

@csubindex[binary files][for foreign tapes]
@defvar tape:*raw-file-canonical-types*
A list of canonical file types which normally contain binary data, not text.
@end(defvar)

@item Defaults for relative host/directory:
This is a pathname used to supply default host and directory components
for merging with relative pathnames found on the tape.
Note that @l(TAR) only stores absolute pathnames (which include the source directory)
when they are specified on the command line.
The target host, used for restoring files, is also defaulted from this option.

On @mouseditem(RESTORE-FILES), the @l("File Restore Transform") parameter
is applied as usual, to allow for more complex pathname transformations.

@end(table)

@sp 1
@textbox
@b(Note:) The TAR-FORMAT driver defines a pathname host named ``TAR-FORMAT''.
@ii(Do not define a host with this name in your site files.)
@end(textbox)

@chapter Known Bugs and Limitations

@section Common LISP Issues

This section outlines issues ZetaLISP-Plus programmers should be aware of regarding
Lambda Common LISP.
The discussion is based on the results of
third-party tests, customer problem reports, and internal investigations.
Some negative results are reported, along with
clarifications of technical issues that have been raised
in regard to potential conflicts with the Common LISP language standard efforts.

This document does not represent any statement or promise to the effect
that compatibility problems will be resolved in any particular manner.
However, the general intention is
to follow the ongoing standards discussions
and to provide a useful Common LISP development environment.
In this light, the following discussion is a clarification of the technical points.

@subsection ZetaLISP Extensions and Optional Errors

The following issues represent either legitimate extensions to Common LISP specifications
or clarifications of issues raised by problem reports.
In many of these cases, where CommonLISP specifies ``optional error'' situations,
ZetaLISP has defined an appropriate behavior.

@include cl-issues

@need 1200
@subsection CommonLISP Incompatibility

For some of the following problem reports,
severe differences between Lambda CommonLISP and ZetaLISP cause significant technical problems.
In some of these situations, the Lambda implementation has difficiencies
that may be addressed by future software updates.

@include cl-bugs

@chapter Installing Release 4

@need 1200
@section Installing Release 4 Band and Microcode

This section summarizes the procedures for installing Release 4 software.
The procedure is identical to that documented
for installing the Release 3 LISP band and microcode
as documented in the @i(Lambda Operations Manual).

@cindex[system host]
If you have multiple Lambda systems, you should
start with the Lambda that acts as your system host.
The system host is the one that will contain important files such
as the network configuration information.
The role of the system host and procedures for updating multiple Lambdas
are discussed in the @i(Lambda Networking Guide).

If you are installing Release 4 LISP on a new system (or on an initialized disk),
you should use the SDU @l(load) program to install the band and microcode partitions
from tape.
If you are upgrading a system that is running a prior release of LISP software,
you can instead install the band and microcode while running in LISP.

@cindex[pack name]
In either case, before you perform the installation, be sure to
check the ``pack name'', as discussed below.
The pack name is a text string stored in the disk label
which determines the names of the system processor(s)
as they boot up.

Use the @l(print) command in the SDU @l(load) program to
view the current pack name.
Use the @l(set-machine-name) command to change the pack name.

The pack name should contain the name of every host processor on the system.
Enter host names in the pack name in the slot order that the corresponding
processor hardware is located
(from right to left, beginning with the slot 0 processor name).

If you are updating a new system, a default pack name
may have been established.
If you will need to customize the Lambda site configuration information,
you may want to also assign your own host names.

In previous releases, it was not required to include the host name
for an attached 68010 Unix processor in the pack name.
Release 4 networking software will not function properly unless the
Unix processor is included; it should be the last name in the pack name.

If you worked with Release 3 before, and you have your own set of working site files,
you should check the pack name to be sure all the hosts are included.
Also remember that you will have to modify and reload your site files
after booting the distribution Release 4 band.

@need 1200
@subsection Begin Installation from the SDU

@itemize @bullet
@item
To begin the installation, first mount the @i(``Release 4 Band/Microcode Tape'') in the tape drive.
@item
Initialize the system by pressing the reset switch on the back of the cabinet.
@item
At the SDU prompt, run @l(load).
@end(itemize)

@need 1200
@subsubsection Setting the Pack Name in LOAD

@cindex[pack name]@cindex[load program]@csubindex[SDU][load]
Use the @l(load) command @l(set-machine-name) to set the pack name to contain
the names of every host processor on the system.

@b(Example:) create the pack name for a system that contains two Lambda processors
and a 68010 Unix processor, using the default host names:

@lisp
>> @i(load)
   :
   :
>> @i(set-machine-name lama lamb unix-a)
   :
   :
@end(lisp)

@need 1200
@subsubsection Installing LISP from the SDU

Within the @l(load) program,
use the @l(install) command to load the Release 4 software partitions.
The @i(``Release 4 Band/Microcode Tape'') contains two copies of the Release 4 microcode
and one copy of the Release 4 distribution load band.

The @l(install) command will load the band and microcode into
``empty'' partitions (if there are any).
For this purpose, empty partitions are indicated by a lack of a label comment.

If all of your LOD and LMC partitions are full, you should first display the disk label by running @l(print).
The @l(install) command will prompt you for the names of two microcode (LMC) partitions, and one
load band (LOD) partition.
You must select partitions that you are willing to overwrite.

@need 1000
For example,

@comment ???this is LISP - get load picture
@lisp
>> @i(load)
using ...k in slot...
load version...
   :
load> @i(print)
unit 0 of glass brahms: eagle; RELEASE GROUP SYSTEM
834 cylinders, 20 heads, 25 blocks per track
** Backup label at track 16707 **
LISP area starts at cylinder 1.
Current microload: LMC1; Current band: LOD1
  UNX6 start 25;  size 1500, "SDU5 3.0 rev 14"
* LMC1 start 1525; size 500, "ULAMBDA 1600"
  LMC2 start 2025; size 500, "ULAMBDA 1600"
  LMC3 start 2525; size 500, ""
  LMC4 start 3025; size 500, ""
   :
  LOD2 start 358175; size 30000, "Rel 3.0"
   :
load> @i(install)
   :
Enter partition...
--> @i(lmc3)
   :
Enter partition...
--> @i(lmc4)
   :
Enter partition...
--> @i(lod2)
   :
@end(lisp)

@cindex[install command]@csubindex[SDU][install]
After the microcode and LISP partitions are restored, @l(install)
will configure the system to boot with the new software  by default.

To set the defaults manually, use the commands @l(set-band) and @l(set-uload).

@need 1000
For example,

@lisp
load> @i(set-band lod2)
load> @i(set-uload lmc2)
@end(lisp)

Use the ``@l(x)'' command to exit @l(load), and then run
@l(newboot -a) to boot with the Release 4 software.

@need 1200
@subsection Installing LISP From LISP

It is possible to install Release 4 LISP while running a previous LISP release
(either Release 2, Release 3, or a pre-release version of Release 4).

@findex[print-disk-label]
Before beginning the installation, execute the LISP command @l[(print-disk-label)]
to list the disk partitions.
You should select two LMC partitions and one LOD partition which will
be overwritten by the new software.
@ii(Write down the names of these partitions.)
Use the tape software to backup existing partitions before you overwrite them.

@cindex[pack name]@findex[si:set-pack-name]
Use the function @l(si:set-pack-name) to set the pack name to contain
all the host processor names.

@need 1000
@b(Example:)

@lisp
(si:set-pack-name "lama lamb unix-a")
@end(lisp)

To begin the installation, first mount the @i(``Release 4 Band/Microcode Tape'') in the tape drive.

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you are booted in Release 2, use the function @l(fs:restore-magtape)
to restore the band and microcode partitions:

@lisp
(fs:restore-magtape)
@end(lisp)

@item
If you are booted in Release 3 or 4, use @l(tape:restore-files):

@lisp
(tape:restore-files)
@end(lisp)

Alternatively, you can use the Tape Frame; press @syson[B], click on the command mode
@mouseditem(RETRIEVE), and then click left on the command @mouseditem(RESTORE-FILES).

@end(itemize)

As the tape software reads the header for each partition, you will be prompted
to enter the name of a target partition (the one to load into).
You will also be asked to confirm that you want to overwrite the contents
of each paritition.

Finally, after the microcode and LISP partitions have been restored,
execute @l(set-current-band) to configure the system to
boot with the new software  by default.

For example,

@lisp
(si:set-current-band 'lod2)
LOD2 goes with ucode 1762, which is not selected.
Partition LMC1 claims to contain ucode 1762.
 Select it? (Y or N) @i(Y)
T
@end(lisp)

@cindex[cold boot]
To cold-boot the entire system:
reset the hardware with the rear panel switch and execute @l(newboot -a) at the SDU prompt.

@need 1200
@section After Booting Release 4

After successfully booting with the distribution band, you will be running
in a software environment with default network configuration information.
The default configuration is probably not appropriate for your environment.
Read the @i(Lambda Networking Guide)
for information on modifying and loading your site files.

@cindex[default site files]
Note that the default network configuration may be acceptable
if @ii(all) of the following conditions are true:

@itemize -
@item
Your Lambda hosts all have unique system names
of the form ``LAMA'', ``LAMB'', etc., through ``LAMH''.
These default names are assigned unique Chaosnet addresses,
which ensures that systems with this default information can
communicate with each other.
@item
The only printer on the network is a TI-855 physically connected
to the host ``LAMA''.
@item
You plan to use Chaosnet communications @ii(only), which provide
networking capability between a limited range of foreign system hosts,
such as other suitably equipped LISP machines.
@end(itemize)

Under any other circumstances, you must follow the complete procedures
for configuring your network.

After completing the network configuration process,
you should proceed to install selected LISP software options and/or sources
from the other tapes provided with your distribution kit.

@need 1200
@section Installing LISP Options

Optional LISP software is contained on the @i(``Release 4 Options Tape'') in
distribution tape format.
Some of these are LISP @ii(systems) which should be loaded into the running LISP
world if they will be accessed frequently.
These systems are:
@include options

If you plan to load any of these systems, you should first
prepare your site files.
Immediately before beginning the optional software installation,
cold-boot the syste host, and load current site information.

@cindex[system host]
You should perform the installation on the system host, the system
that is defined in your site files as containing the sources and system files for
your network.

To begin the installation, mount the @i(``Release 4 Options Tape'') in the tape drive.
In the Initial Lisp Listener, execute the following:

@lisp
(tape:install-distribution-tape)
@end(lisp)

During the installation you will be prompted
at each step for all the information required by the procedure.
Following is a summary of each phase of the installation:

@enumerate

@item Introduce options -
lists out the available options, and optionally provides additional information
on each option.

@item Installation parameters -
confirm the name of the system host, the host to which files will be restored.
Also, determine whether files must be restored from tape before the desired
systems can be loaded.

@item Select options -
you are presented with a menu of available options.
For each option to be restored, click under the indicated column.
If an option is a system that can be loaded, click under the indicated column if
you want the system loaded.

@item System files -
this step makes sure that the system host is available, and that the procedure
can get to the required system definition files.
Any problems with your loaded site information will be explained, along with
remedial suggestions.

@item Restore -
copy files for selected options from tape to disk.

@item Copying -
copy system files for selected systems into your site file directory.

@item Execute commands -
run @l(make-system) to load any selected systems.

@end(enumerate)

When you have completed the installation, you may want to save the running LISP environment to disk.
This is only necessary if you have loaded any of the optional systems.

@include disksave

@need 1200
@section Installing LISP Sources

@cindex[sources]
At times you may  find it useful to look up the definition of system functions.
For example, you can use the ZMacs command @meta[.] to locate the definition of
a system function such as @l(print-herald) to find out how to access the kind of
information that function displays.

To load the LISP sources, mount the @i(``Release 4 Sources'') tape in the tape drive.
Execute the LISP command @l[(tape:restore-files)].
Interaction with the procedure should not be required, unless there
is a problem with your file system or the tape drive.

@need 1200
@section Copying Release 4 Software to Other Lambdas

If you have multiple Lambda systems, you will want to copy
the Release 4 software from the system host to every other system.
If the systems are interconnected by Ethernet,
you can use the function @l(si:copy-disk-partition) to copy the microcode and load bands
to each system.
The @i(Networking Guide), in the chapter on ``Configuration Procedures'',
describes the procedure for copying load bands across the network.

If you have Lambdas that are not physically connected via Ethernet,
you must use a tape drive on each system to restore the Release 4 software.
See the @i(Tape Software Guide) for information on making a tape.
Your tape should include the distributed microcode partition
as well as a copy of your updated, customized Release 4 load band.
