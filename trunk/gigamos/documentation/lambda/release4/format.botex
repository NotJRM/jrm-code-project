Some of @l(FORMAT)'s directives have been fixed to work as advertised:

@itemize @bullet
@item The @l[~\time\] and @l[~\datime\] directives now behave identically;

@item The @l[~\scientific\] directive now prints out "pico", "femto", and
"atto" when supplied with arguments of the appropriate magnitudes;

@item The sequence @l[~:@@P] now backs up one argument in the control
string's argument sequence;

@item The sequence @l[~0&] no longer outputs a fresh-line.

@end(itemize)
