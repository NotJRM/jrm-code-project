@subsection Changes to ZMacs Functionality

@metax[Edit Definition] (also invoked with @meta[.])
now accepts mouse-sensitive items as minibuffer input:

@itemize @bullet

@item
A left mouse click on a highlighted symbol
selects it as the function whose definition to edit;
@item
A right mouse click inserts the highlighted string into the
minibuffer for manual confirmation (or editing).
@end(itemize)

@metax[Source Compare] and
@metax[Source Compare Merge]
now use the advertised file or buffer defaults properly.

@metax[Kill Some Buffers]
now waits to ask about the current buffer until after all other buffers
have been resolved.

@ctrlx[k] (Kill Buffer)
now allows any buffer to be killed, even if no others exist.  In case
the user kills the last buffer, a new, empty buffer is automatically
generated for immediate use.

@ctrlx[Control-F] (Find File)
now probes for the existence of the specified file even if an associated
buffer already exists for it.  If the file was deleted after its
contents were read into the associated buffer, a note to that effect is
printed out in the minibuffer window.

@metax[Install Command]
now searches other packages for a definition of the command specified,
in case it fails to find a definition in the current package.

@metax[Copy File] and
@metax[Rename File],
when given wildcarded pathnames, now print out the
intended source and destination pathnames during the confirmation
request.

@ctrl[S] (Incremental Search) and
@ctrl[R] (Reverse Incremental Search)
accept a new sub-command keystroke.
During the course of a search, both functions now interpret a @ctrl[W]
as a command to append the word currently at point to the end of the
target string.

@metax[Find System Files] and
@metax[Select System as Tags Table]
have been fixed to find files in the order in which they are
defined by DEFSYSTEM.
Component subsystems and their files are also
found in the proper order.

@ctrlx[d] and @cctrlx[d],
with a numeric argument of 1, correctly list only those files in the
default directory with the same first name as the current file.

@subsection New ZMacs Commands

@metax[Evaluate And Print Into Buffer]
reads the s-expression
beginning at point, replacing it with whatever is printed to
@l[*STANDARD-OUTPUT*] over the course of its evaluation.

@metax[Create One Buffer To Go]
creates a new, empty buffer.

@metax[Common Lisp Mode]
sets the @l(:readtable) attribute to @l("CL") (see below).

@subsection New Common LISP Mode for ZMacs

When a buffer's attributes specify Common LISP syntax, incompatible global symbols
receive Common Lisp definitions.
It is important to set the readtable attribute properly for CommonLISP code
to work correctly.

To support this better,
There is now a Common Lisp Mode command for ZMacs, invoked with @metax[Common Lisp Mode].
The command puts the buffer into LISP Mode and sets its @l(:SYNTAX) and @l(:READTABLE) attributes to @l("CL").

The @l(:READTABLE) and @l(:SYNTAX) attributes of a file are
set to "CommonLISP" before the file's contents are read in.
It is recommended, however, that the user always execute
the @metax[Update Attribute List] command after reading in any Common LISP files written
in non-Lambda environments.
ZMacs understands both
"CommonLisp" and "Common-Lisp" as spellings for the Common LISP attribute.

@subsection Changes to DIRED

When marking multiple files for deletion upon exiting DIRED, only those
that have been successfully deleted are marked with a "d" or removed
from the display (when expunging has been selected).

The DIRED commands for copying (`C'), renaming (`R'), and source
comparing (`=') files now respect the full default filenames they
display.

DIRED's ``Next Hogs'' command  (`N') which seeks out files with excessive numbers of
versions has been improved:

@itemize @bullet

@item Directories are no longer considered to be hogs;

@item The first file group in a DIRED listing is no longer exempt from the
search for hogs;

@item Typing `N' on any blank line in a DIRED listing no longer
generates an error.
@end(itemize)

@subsection Improved Tags Searching Capabilities

Users may now perform parallel tags searches through different tag
tables.  The @metax[Select Tag Table] command records the status of the
current Tags Search before beginning a new one.  To resume any previous
search, type @metax[Select Tag Table], and specify the tag table
associated with the desired searching context, by name.  Subsequent
@ctrl[.] keystrokes will continue that tags search, using the string
which was being sought when the search was suspended.

Alternatively, the user may wish to undertake a new Tags Search
operation, for a new string altogether, beginning at the point where a
previous tags search was suspended.  To do this, simply supply a
@ctrl[u] argument to @metax[Tags Search]; the current tag table will be
used, and subsequent @ctrl[.]'s will search for the newly-specified string.
The keystroke @cm[Space] attempts to return the user to the
point at which the change of search context took place, without resuming
either search operation.
When selecting and defining a new tag table,
the previously active search string is the default search string for the new tag table.

When defining a new tag table with @metax[Select Some Buffers As Tag
Table] command, the user now has the option of typing @endkey@  at any
time during the query sequence.  This finishes off
the current tag table without including the current buffer (or any
further buffers).

Mouse-sensitive items may now be used to provide target strings to
@metax[Tags Search] invocations.  A left mouse-click chooses the
highlighted symbol as the one on which to perform a tags search, and a
right mouse-click inserts the highlighted symbol into the minibuffer for
confirmation or editing.

In addition, Select Tag Table now
supports the standard @cs[Y]  mechanism,  placing the default tag table name
(displayed in the ensuing prompt) into the minibuffer for confirmation
or editing.

All Tag Tables must now have unique names.  The commands @metax[Select
Some Buffers As Tag Table] and @metax[Select All Buffers As Tag Table]
prompt the user for a name for the newly-created tag table after all
appropriate buffers have been located.

A new command, @metax[List Tag Buffers], displays all buffers read in
for a specified tag table.  The buffer names in this display are all
mouse sensitive, much like the buffers listed in
a @cctrlx[b] (List Buffers) display.  List Tag Buffers also indicates
which buffer contains the most recently found occurrence of the current
tags search string, as well as the string itself.

Finally, the @metax[List Tag Tables] display has been made more readable; in
addition, the display indicates which of the known tag tables is
currently selected.  A new command, @metax[Current Tag Table], prints
out the name of the current tag table in the minibuffer. If no
tag tables have been defined, the string "Done." appears in the
minibuffer only; a typeout window is not used unless one or more tag
tables have been defined.

@subsection Set Package

Various problems with the behaviour of @metax[Set Package] have been resolved.

The method of finding a default package has been improved.
The default is taken from either
@enumerate
@item ZMac's current "default package",
which is set (for example) by a buffer's attribute list; or
@item the current setting of *PACKAGE*; or
@item the USER package as a last resort.
@end(enumerate)

Now, if the user presses @return@  without entering a package, ZMacs will use the displayed default.
Pressing @cs[Y] brings the default package into the minibuffer.

To specify a package that doesn't already exist, exit the
first prompt with @ctrl[@return], or press @return@  twice.
Then confirm by typing ``YES''.

@subsection Miscellaneous Improvements

Buffer sections containing DEFSTRUCTs in a buffer are now correctly
parsed by all Zwei commands which manipulate sections of code (List
Sections, List Changed Sections, etc.)

The command Set Pop Mark (@ctrl[@spacekey]) now works as advertised with numeric arguments.

The function @l(ZWEI:DOCUMENT-KEY) now displays its output on *STANDARD-OUTPUT*
regardless of the type of stream.

@cs[Y] now generates the warning ``There is no default in this context''
when there is no default for the current command.
