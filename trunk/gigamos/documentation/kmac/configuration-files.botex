@chapter Configuration Record File

A Macintosh file will hold certain information
to be managed by the K/Mac application and passed to
the K processor(s) at boot time.
The configuration record data items include:

@enumerate
@item Processor(s) (serial #) to run within the application;
@item Mac's (host) name;
@item Memory enabled/disabled sections; and
@item Volume and File-ID of default world load file.
@end(enumerate)

There is no uniform standard for where to look for the host name on the Mac.
For example, TOPS (one popular network software package) stores it as the "User Name" 'STR ' resource.
It puts this in the file "Tops Prep", which does not exist if some other network software is
being used.

The ``world load file''  is the K/Mac equivalent of the Lambda ``load band''.

@center Montreal notes:

Configuration Proms w/ the bus coupler, the Mac slot manager
will not understand declarations on the other (K?) side.  The Montreal
team will have to hardwire bus coupler declarations.  The Cambridge team
will provide (Pascal?) code once we have received information on the NuBus'
K registers.

Configuration files (and any other files needed by the Mac application
itself) will have to be covered by a separate filetype, called "KMac".
