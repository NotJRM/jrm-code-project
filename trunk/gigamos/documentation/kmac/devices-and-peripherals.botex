@chapter Devices and Peripherals

A uniform approach to devices must be adopted
for all peripherals, such as Network Tables, Serial Streams,
Tape Ports, and Raw Floppies.
Not all such devices will be supported in the initial release.

@section Tape Devices

LMFL tape format should be adaptable for use with Mac files, preserving
integrity of file and its contents:

@example
property list (most properties) stream  <-> Resource Fork
data stream                             <-> Data Fork
@end(example)

Backups: in Release 1, bits will not be stored in a resource, but rather in backup logs.
These ``side files'' will serve as final authority on files' statuses.

Need to know: How does the Mac tape device work?  Ideally, the tape software
could produce transportable floppies for LISP users.

Need to write: OPEN-RESOURCE-FORK (OPEN needs to know which fork to act upon)

@center Montreal notes:

Last Backup date recorded as a Mac file info field.  Let's use it, make
it an inferrable property.

Montreal's structures can handle floppy disks.
