@chapter Booting the K from the Macintosh

The following discussion concerns booting the K-Machine from the Macintosh application.

The K/Mac boot process and the user's interface
differ from the ``brute force'' approach used to boot the K from the Lambda.

This chapter needs further research and refinement before the Montreal side can
do much with it.

@section K/Mac Boot Process

K/Mac applications (those responsible for booting up the K from
the Macintosh) use a standard boot procedure:

Late in the sequence, the K performs certain operations in series with
steps performed by the Macintosh application.
These K boot operations are numbered in conjunction with the Mac operations listed above.

@center Montreal notes:

We will need to support a Klod filetype for load bands.

There should be a table in K memory of supported filetypes and their
associated properties, which in turn will be passed back as
arguments in calls to OPEN, etc.

It will be acceptable for the Mac to make (default) assumptions about
filetypes; however, the K will always have override power for all
translations decisions.

We should have the ability to choose load bands from the control panel,
with double clicks, and with K functions.
