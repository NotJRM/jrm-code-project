;;; the branch destination into their code.  Such forms can say that
;;; outputting the branch at the end is superfluous by setting *BDEST* to NIL.
;;; Forms which perform unconditional transfers need not worry about *BDEST*
;;; since it will be output and then discarded as unreachable.

;;; An unconditional branch destination can accompany any value of DEST.
;;; A conditional branch should only be used with DEST = K:R0 (was D-INDS).
;;; This is taken to imply that the indicators are used by the branch,
;;; not that the indicators will be correctly set up after the optimized
;;; code is finished branching or not.  If you wish to compile something
;;; and want the indicators correctly set up according to its value,
;;; you should use K:R0 (was D-INDS) with no *BDEST*, and do your branching yourself.

;;; Branches which pop the pdl may not be used as branch destinations.
;;; Most people who look at *BDEST* don't check for them,
;;; and the optimizations that *BDEST* is used for wouldn't work for them anyway.

;;; A funny kind of branch that can be used as a destination is
;;; (BRANCH ALWAYS NO-OP NIL tag).  It is a sort of unconditional branch,
;;; used when the tag to be branched to is known to be right after
;;; this expression, so that one might think that no branch is needed at all.
;;; When OUTB-for-k is called on such a branch, it does nothing.
;;; But some functions (such as AND and OR) can optimize these no-op branches
;;; like any other unconditional branches.

;;; An even funnier kind of branch destination is the return branch:
;;; (BRANCH ALWAYS RETURN NIL tag).  This is given as the branch destination
;;; to the last statement in a PROG, so that if the statement is a RETURN
;;; then the implicit (RETURN NIL) at the end of the PROG can be omitted
;;; and the RETURN at the end can just drop through to the PROG's rettag.
;;; Return branch destinations may not be passed along to subexpressions
;;; by AND, OR and COND.
