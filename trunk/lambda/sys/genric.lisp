  "Return SEQUENCE, partially copied so that elements matching ITEM are omitted.
START and END specify a subsequence to consider; elements outside
 that subsequence will not be removed even if they would match.
 They default to 0 and NIL (which means the end of the sequence).
KEY, if non-NIL, is a function to be applied to each element
 to get the object to match against ITEM.  If KEY is NIL,
 the element itself is matched.
TEST is a function of two args to use to compare ITEM against an element (or key).
 An element matches when the TEST function returns non-NIL.
 Alternatively, specify as TEST-NOT a function to use which returns NIL if there is a match.
COUNT can be used to specify how many elements to remove (at maximum);
 after that many have been found, the rest are left alone.
FROM-END, if non-NIL, means that the last COUNT matching elements
 should be removed, rather than the first COUNT many."
