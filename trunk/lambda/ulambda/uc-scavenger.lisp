;;; Scavenge queue.

;;; The scavenge queue is a small (1024 word) area of memory managed in a stack-like fashion
;;; to do approximately depth-first copying of objects in the transporter (and thus the
;;; scavenger).  Each entry on the queue is one word, consisting of a 25-bit address and a
;;; 7-bit word count.  The address is the address of the next word to be scavenged, the count
;;; is the remaining words in the entry.  When every word is looked at, the entry on the queue
;;; is updated (looking at a word can cause more objects to appear on the queue, so this whole
;;; process must be very reentrant) by incrementing the address and decrementing the word
;;; count.  When the count for an object gets to zero, the object is popped off the queue, and
;;; then that word is looked at (sort of tail-recursively).

;;; Yes, this code is pretty simple.  However, there are some non-trivial interactions with
;;; TRANS-OLD-COPY that you have to be careful about.

;;; This code probably does more scavenging than scavenge block.  If I am reading the code
;;; correctly, every time a q is transported, we come through here via trans-old-copy which
;;; pushes some stuff and calls the scavenge queue.  Unfortunately, the scavenge queue does
;;; quite a bit of memory cycles and hangs on most of them.  This code could use some
;;; pipelining and I think that would have a noticable impact on the cost of scavenging
;;; level 3 and 2.

;;; Scanning on swap-out.

;;; All reference volatilities, if left to their own devices, will rise monotonically to
;;; most-volatile and stay there, negating all the benefit of the scheme.  To prevent this from
;;; happening, pages are scanned at various times to determine their correct volatility -- the
;;; volatility of the most-volatile pointer on the page.
;;;
;;; Note that there are two basic ways that more-volatile pointers can be removed from a page.
;;; Lisp program activity can overwrite volatile pointers (I think this is pretty rare).  More
;;; importantly, when the scavenger scans a page that has pointers of volatility N, by definition
;;; when the scavenger is done the maximum possible volatility is N-1.  This principle also
;;; applies in a probabilistic way to the localizer.
;;;
;;; The effect of letting the reference volatility of a page rise higher than it needs to be
;;; is that at some point the scavenger will examine it unnecessarily.  Examining a page that
;;; already resides in primary memory is not too painful (more on that later), but if the page
;;; has been swapped out to the disk, the overhead of swapping it back in, only to find out that
;;; it wasn't really needed, is unacceptable.  Therefore, we try to ensure that non-resident pages
;;; always have their correct volatility.
;;;
;;; The best way to implement this is to scan every modified page as it is being written back to
;;; the disk in preparation for reuse of a page frame.  There is a problem with this: we (theoretically)
;;; can not scan a page without the aid of the structure handles to decipher the object boundaries
;;; on a page.  Unfortunately, the structure handles are not and can not be wired; since the scanning
;;; occurs deep inside the page fault handler, accessing the structure handles would require
;;; arbitrary levels of recursion in the hard-fault handler.
;;;
;;; Without the aid of the structure handles, we cannot avoid looking at untagged storage.  It
;;; turns out that this is actually acceptable -- as long as we're not depending on the actual
;;; meaning of words of memory, we can scan through looking for volatile "pointers" without danger.
;;; Of course, the results are only probabilistic.  However, measurements indicate that we get the
;;; correct answer between 98-99% of the time, which is perfectly reasonable.
;;;
;;; The overall effect of this is to reduce the disk traffic required to scavenge levels 1, 2 and 3
;;; if the pages have had a chance to migrate to the disk.  In practice, almost all storage involved in
;;; level 3 flips is in core anyway, so this scheme really only affects level 1 and 2 flips.  The
;;; overall gain appears to be a 2x - 3x reduction in paging during level 1 and 2 GCs.
;;;
;;; I think it is moderately important to try to keep the volatility of resident pages correct.
;;; Moon thinks it's unnecessary (he says the 3600 has scanning hardware to scan pages in about
;;; 80 microseconds).  The Lambda, however, takes about 500 microseconds to scavenge a page.
;;; Fortunately, a small amount of overhead in the scavenger (setting the volatility of a page
;;; to zero before scanning, then reading and writing every word to take transport and volatility
;;; traps) can guarantee that the page will have the correct volatility.  I think this small overhead
;;; (figure about 20% of the cost of scavenging a page) is worth the effort -- it prevents pages
;;; from being needlessly scavenged 2, 3, 4... times.

;;; VOLATILITY-SCAN-PAGE is called for every page written to the disk by DISK-SWAP-HANDLER.  It
;;; runs in parallel with the disk (primarily with the seek, so I don't think bus bandwidth is
;;; a problem).  It may take map faults and pdl-buffer faults, but obviously can't take any
;;; hard faults.  We do a GC-WRITE-TEST on every word on the page, but the only action we can
;;; take as a result is to update the volatility.  If an untagged word happens to have a pointer
;;; data-type and a pointer field that points to volatile storage, then we will get a too-high
;;; answer.  This doesn't happen too often, but just to help limit the lossage, we don't let the
;;; final volatility rise above the initial volatility.

;;; Post-mortem:
;;; There were some initial problems with this (it made pages be modified even after they
;;; were written to the disk, it changed pages' swap-status to normal) that caused performance
;;; to degrade dramatically when I first installed this.  After fixing all the (known)
;;; problems with it, we ran some benchmarks which showed that there was really no effect
;;; on performance.  I don't know why, but for now I'm deleting it.

;;; Post-post-mortem:
;;; It appears that a bug was introduced in the system that seriously affected the paging
;;; performance of the machine.  This went unfixed for a very long time.  During this time,
;;; the benchmarks for the volatility scanning were run and showed no effect.  Now, the paging
;;; bug is fixed and I'm uncommenting the code to see if it wins.
