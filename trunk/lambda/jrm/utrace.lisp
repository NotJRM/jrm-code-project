;;; There are several kludges in this file among which are:
;;;
;;;    The microtracer is run in a different stack group so as to avoid overflowing
;;;    the pdl which cannot be extended because of a microcode bug.
;;;
;;;    Some internal procedures have been externalized because there are only
;;;    64 locals in any procedure.
;;;
;;; Kludges may be found by looking for flaming comments.

;;; The microtracer is very recursive and tends to overflow the pdl.
;;; Since the code that extends the pdl seems to be broken, we make a stack
;;; group with a large regular pdl explicitly for the microtracer.
;;; A kludge is born.
