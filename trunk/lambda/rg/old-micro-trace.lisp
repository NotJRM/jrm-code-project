;state changes consist of register-dependance or register-modification.
;  The tree to be searched is defined as follows:
;    start at address, trace successors, and successors of successors, etc watching for loops.
;  Desired output is two lists:
;       register-modification list.
;       register-dependance list.
;  register-modification list is simply the IOR of all dests of all uinsts in entire tree.
;  register-dependance list is IOR of all sources of all uinsts, subtracting, however,
;    any that were modified in the particular patch prior to the point they were sourced.
;
; register <n> should be on the registers-sourced list if any path of control
;    possible starting at <ADDRESS> can reference the original contents of register <n>.
;    (a reference after it has been stored in would not count.)
; register <n> should be on the registers-clobbered list if it is modified
;    by any path starting at <ADDRESS>.

;the flow is traced by starting at ADDRESS and following successors.  Two conditions are
;  watched for.
;  (1)  A loop, ie the same location already exists in the recursive descent path.
;       Since then, more locations could have gotten clobbered, which would result in
;       fewer top level dependancies, so nothing needs to be done now.
;  (2)  A cross, ie the location has been visited before, although it is not on the current path.
;       if the same or more registers have been clobbered now as before, do nothing.
;       this is only a speedwise optimization, compared to following the path again.

;given we start grubbling at an arbitrary place (called the head).  Trace the flow of control
; accumulating registers clobbered and registers sourced.  These are both monotonic
; functions, (except for knowing about saving and restoring).  So they can be "propagated back"
; at any time, adding to whats previously been propagated back.
; The following interesting things can happen:
;  (1)  we source a new register.
;  (2)  we source a register which has been previously clobbered.
;  (3)  we clobber a new register.
;  (4)  we clobber again a previously clobberred register
;  (5)  we reach a return.  Propagate registers clobbered and sourced back to the head.
;       registers sourced represent arguments or possible "dependancies"
;       registers clobbered represent results or possible side effects
;  (6)  we "close a loop".  Comparing registers-clobbered and registers-sourced now to then,
;       consider following cases:
;         a register was clobbered then, but isnt now.  This could be a new dependancy.
;         a register is clobbered now, but wasnt then.  This could be a new side effect.
;         a register was sourced then, but isnt now.
;         a register is sourced now, but wasnt then. This could be a new dependancy.
