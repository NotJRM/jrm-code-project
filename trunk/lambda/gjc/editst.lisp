;; Lisp Machine Editor Stream

;; The rubout handler implemented here is a crock since it duplicates
;; the functions of ZWEI.  However, this editor is implemented in terms of stream
;; operations, and thus can be used from consoles other than the
;; local Lisp Machine console.  This file makes use of the definitions
;; in LMMAX;UTILS.

;; There are a couple ideas here:
;; The editor stream itself is separated from the underlying console
;; stream.  This is nice since the console stream need know nothing about
;; the rubout handler, and thus rubout handlers can be changed easily
;; without having to duplicate the code for the entire console stream.
;; In addition, it makes it easy to have one editor stream work for
;; different console streams.

;; Another thought would be to split the bare console stream into
;; an input stream from a keyboard and an output stream to a window
;; on a given monitor.  The editor stream would then bind these two
;; streams together into a single interactive i/o stream.  I can't see
;; much use for this, unless somebody wanted a keyboard stream without
;; having a window, or there were multiple keyboard types in use.

;; Terminology:

;; CONSOLE-STREAM -- a bi-directional stream to some console.  This stream
;;                   knows nothing about rubout handling.
;; EDITOR-STREAM -- a bi-directional stream connected to some console stream.
;;                  It handles both the :RUBOUT-HANDLER and :UNTYI stream operations.
;; TV-STREAM -- a bi-directional stream to the Lisp Machine console.  Special
;;              case of a console stream.
;; SUPDUP-STREAM -- a bi-directional stream to a console connected via the
;;                  Chaos net.  Special case of a console stream.

;; MAKE-TV-STREAM takes a piece of paper, and returns a
;; stream which talks to the TV terminal of the Lisp Machine.  For input,
;; it uses the keyboard.  For output, it types on the piece of paper.

;; Below are two editor functions which form a part of the editor stream.
;; The first is a simple display editor which is a partial emacs, and the
;; second is a printing terminal rubout handler for use via supdup.

;; These functions get called whenever a :TYI message is sent to the stream
;; and we are inside the rubout handler.  If the user types a normal
;; character it is echoed, put in the buffer, and returned.  If the user
;; types a rubout, or any other editing character, any number of editing
;; commands are processed by modifying the buffer, then, when the first
;; non-editing character is typed, a throw is done back to the top level of
;; the read function and the buffered input will be re-scanned.  The
;; character must be typed at the end of the line in order for the throw to
;; take place.  This may be a bug.
