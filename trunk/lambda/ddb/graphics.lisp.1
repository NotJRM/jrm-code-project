  "compute cubic splines.  px and py are arrays of x-coords and y-coords.
they describe a sequeuce of points through which a smooth
curve should be drawn.  this program generates z intermediate
points between each pair of points, returning a sequence of points
in cx and cy that includes the original points with the intermediate
points inserted.  the caller can then plot lines between successive
pairs of points of cx and cy to draw the curve.

the caller may pass in arrays to be filled in with the answers (used as
cx and cy); they should be (+ n (* z (- n 1))) long.  if nil is passed,
this function creates the arrays itself.  if they are not long enough,
they are adjusted with adjust-array-size.

the optional argument c1 is the initial end condition, one of
:relaxed, :clamped, :cyclic, or :anti-cyclic; c2 is the final end
condition, one of :relaxed or :clamped.  the first defaults to
:relaxed, and the second defaults to the first.  the second must be
the same as the first if the first is :cyclic or :anti-cyclic.  the
last four arguments are the x and y values to which the endpoints are
being clamped if the corresponding boundary condition is :clamped.
for cyclic splines that join themselves, the caller must pass the same
point twice, as both the first point and the last point.

p1-prime-x, etc., specify the slopes at the two endpoints,
for the sake of :clamped constraints.

three values are returned: the two arrays cx and cy, and the number
of active elements those arrays."
