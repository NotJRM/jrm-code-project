The automatic garbage collector is enabled.

There are 8,337,766 words of dynamic space, 388,945 words of static space, and
21,703,588 words of free space.  Free space consists of 19,431,424 words of unallocated
storage plus 1/2 of the 4,544,325 words of storage already allocated to specific
regions but not yet used.

Dynamic space storage distribution:
