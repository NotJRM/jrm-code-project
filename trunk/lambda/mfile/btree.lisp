;A BTREE is a (hopefully) efficient associative mechanism.
;  On a retreival operation, the input is a KEY to be found.  They
;key may be a number or a string.  Any node of the
;BTREE to be referenced will serve as a starting point for the retreival.
;The reply is a single associated Q.

;  To help keep terminology straight, data obtained from a BTREE structure
;is prefixed by B- in the below discussion.

;  A BTREE consists of layers of nodes.  Each node is capable of containing a moderate
;number of node elements, typically 10. to 100.  The bottom layer contains FINAL-ASSOCIATIONS,
;while the upper layers, (if required) are DIVISORs containing SUBNODE-POINTERs.
;(We require all FINAL-ASSOCIATIONs to be on the bottom layer since otherwise
;excessive complications are introduced in node balancing.  Also the range mapped by
;the bottom layer becomes discontinuous if FINAL-ASSOCIATIONs are stored in higher layers).
;The topmost BTREE layer is always a single node, called TOP-NODE.  If the amount
;of information stored in the BTREE is quite small, TOP-NODE can be an FINAL-ASSOCIATION
;node, in which case the entire scheme degenerates into a sorted table within TOP-NODE.
;Once the information to be stored fails to fit in a single node, TOP-NODE will always
;be a DIVISOR.
;  Each layer, taken as a whole (and the BTREE itself), "MAPs" (or contains information
;relavant to) the same total KEY range.   The nodes within a particular layer
;are sorted monotonically, left to right ("least" to "greatest"),
;and contain pointers to their left and right neighboring BTREE nodes.  The node elements within
;a node are also sorted left to right.  Each node MAPs a continuous interval of KEYs.
;A node specifies its mapped range "inclusively", ie, N+1 keys specify N divisions.
;(Making them inclusive allows realization of the need to step up the tree
;if the search has started at a subnode but the key being searched for is out of range
;of that subnode.)  However, the "odd" (N+1st) key is stored in a different way from the
;others (in KEY-OF-RIGHT-MARGIN).  The range of a node is considered to
;be a half-open interval, that is, the least key is within the range, but the greatest key
;(called KEY-OF-RIGHT-MARGIN) is just outside the range.  Since all layers are continuous,
;KEY-OF-RIGHT-MARGIN of a node is equal to the first element of its right layer-level neighbor
;(except at the right edge of the BTREE when KEY-OF-RIGHT-MARGIN is NIL).
;  When an entry is to be added to the BTREE, the first step is to locate the lowest
;"containing" DIVISOR node, called the DOMINATING node (excepting the simple case
;that TOP-NODE is a FINAL-ASSOCIATION node).  No node in the BTREE
;higher than the DOMINATING node will need to be modified or examined unless the
;DOMINATING node overflows.
;  Next, a ROOM-TEST is made to insure that sufficient room exists in all nodes in which
;it will be required.  If not, SPLITs or SHUFFLEs are performed as necessary (note that during
;this process the logical content of the BTREE has not as yet been changed).
;Finally, the desired new entry is made, which simply involves inserting it in a
;FINAL-ASSOCIATION node which, it has been determined, already has sufficient room.
;  During the ROOM-TEST, it may initially be the case that the FINAL-ASSOCIATION
;node which MAPs the given key is full.  There are two methods of dealing with the
;situation, called SPLITs and SHUFFLEs.
;  A SHUFFLE may be used where either the LEFT or RIGHT neighboring BTREE node
;to the overflowing node has sufficient room and also shares a common parent node
;with the overflowing node.  Data is simply moved over, and the dividing pointer
;in the common parent node is adjusted.  (If there is no common parent node,
;the hair required is too much to be worth it.  Also note that if the layer being shuffled
;is a DIVISOR layer, the parent pointers of the data shuffled must be adjusted).
;  Otherwise a SPLIT is necessary, involving dividing the data of the overflowing node into
;two nodes and adding a new dividing pointer to the parent node.  The condition that
;this will cause the parent node to overflow is tested and dealt with before
;any other modifications are undertaken, (which could involve a SHUFFLE or SPLIT at that
;level, etc).  The left-right linkages must also be adjusted appropriately.
;  If in this process TOP-NODE overflows, a TOP-SPLIT occurs which generates a
;new layer of nodes.  (Other SPLITs make more nodes in given layer, not more layers).

;  Evidently, each node is always at least half full since that is the case immediately
;after a SPLIT. (Exceptions concern TOP-NODE, either if it is a FINAL-ASSOCIATION node
;or immediately after a TOP-SPLIT).

;  BTREE items can be deleted as desired.  In doing this, we preserve the at-least-half-full
;property of BTREE nodes.   So doing not only guarentees a minimal level of storage
;efficiency, but also simplifies the code that would otherwise have to exist
;to deal with NULL BTREE nodes, if they were permitted to arise.
;  If, as a result of a deletion, a node becomes less that half full, rebalancing action
;is initiated.  The first possibility is to SHUFFLE data from the LEFT or RIGHT nodes
;which share a common parent.  (At least one of them must share a parent.)  If such a
;node is more than half full, the situation can be relieved by shuffling over data,
;leaving each at least half full.  If such a node is exactly half-full, a REVERSE-SPLIT
;can occur, concentrating the data in a single node.  This involves deletion of a
;divisor pointer, which node may then need to be rebalanced, etc.  Note that the
;process proceeds by steps each of which represents a valid state for the entire BTREE
;(excepting the half-full property).  If a reverse split happen at the level immediately
;below TOP-NODE which would reduce TOP-NODE to a single item, then a REVERSE-TOP-SPLIT occurs.
;This destroys a BTREE layer.  Note if a layer were to collapse so as to be only one node
;wide, this would insure a rebalance at the next higher level since that level would only
;have a single pointer which would make it less than half full.

;Deleting the leftmost or rightmost element of a node:
; If the leftmost element of a node is deleted, the range mapped by that node
;is reduced.  To maintain the continuity of the layer involved, the right-range of
;the left-adjacent node must be adjusted (recall that for nodes not at the right
;edge of the BTREE, the right-range is equal to the leftmost entry of the right
;neighbor).  Furthermore, the divisor pointer in the parent needs to be adjusted.
;If that pointer is the leftmost element in its divisor node, the processs must
;be continued, etc.
; Deleting the rightmost element in a node does not cause special problems.

;Containing invervals:
;  If a BTREE associates numeric keys, data in the BTREE can be associated not only with a single key,
;but also with a RANGE of them.  These RANGEs are stored in the
;BTREE in non-overlapping form.  B-RANGE intervals can only be associated
;with FINAL-ASSOCIATION type BTREE node elements, not with DIVISORs.
;  B-RANGEs are "relative", ie, if the Nth item of the B-RANGE is referenced,
;the association is the FINAL-ASSOCIATION of the B-RANGE plus N.  B-RANGEs are
;also stored as half-open intervals, the B-RANGE-LIMIT being the highest element of the
;range, plus one.
;  The lowest member of the B-RANGE is stored as the B-KEY in the normal BTREE
;fashion, and B-RANGE-LIMIT is stored as subsidary data under this key.
;No other entry can "break" the B-RANGE; that is, next key in the BTREE node
;must be at least B-RANGE-LIMIT.

;--no now it splits it.. --   However, under a B-RANGE entry can be stored
;an EXCEPTION pointer.  This points to a separate BTREE node, which can list
;EXCEPTIONs to the range, as appropriate.

;Storing intervals
;  Complexities can be involved if the RANGE being stored LAPs a preexisting RANGE
;within the system.  (Two intervals are said to LAP if neither is contained within
;the other, but they have a non-null intersection).  Either stored key-ranges or
;mapped ranges can cause problems.  The general approach to avoiding the problem
;is to split the store into one or more segments so as to avoid any LAPping.
;  A few cases are distinguished either because they are simple,
;or because of necessity.  In particular, if the edge of the BTREE is involved,
;it must be extended rather than attempting to segment the RANGE.
;  A STORE-RANGE-TEST operation is performed to determine how much of the range
;can be stored without creating any LAPping segments.  (One optimization
;made during the STORE-RANGE-TEST is that if a previous element is being completely
;overstored, it is deleted rather than allowing it to cause segmentation.)
;  Then, if any of the orginal range remains to be stored, it
;is stored as a separate segment.

;The format of the "array-leader part" of a distributed BTREE node is always the same.
;Notable is the KEY-OF-RIGHT-MARGIN, which specifies the key just out of range of
;this node to the right or NIL if on RIGHT-MARGIN.

;The format of the "array part" of a distributed BTREE node depends on whether the
;node is a FINAL-ASSOCIATION node (1) or DIVISOR (2).

;DIVISORs have alternating KEYs and SUBNODE-POINTERs.  The comparison used
;is key-<, thus, the leftmost key in each node is in the range mapped by the node.
;However, the rightmost key, contained in KEY-OF-RIGHT-MARGIN is just outside
;the high end of the range of the node.

;FINAL-ASSOCIATIONs have alternating KEYs and FINAL-ASSOCIATIONs.  However, if the
;data type of a Q in the KEY position is DTP-CHARACTER (randomly), it is really
;a range delta specifier for the previous key.
;  the paired Q used to be an exception pointer but now is unused.
;    Following it is the associated EXCEPTION pointer.

;entering new data which extends the range of the BTREE.
;  If an attempt is made to store an item outside the current MAPPED range of the
;entire BTREE, the process will ascend to
;TOP-NODE, when situation must be recognized and handled.  Then the limiting
;entries must be modified down the entire edge of the tree.  To avoid embarresment,
;first assure there is room in the bottommost node where a new entry must be made.

;entering ranges in the BTREE.
;  In most cases, a range type BTREE entry can be made as a single element in the BTREE.
;Sometimes, however, this may not be true (without excessive hair, anyway).
;Generally, the range structure of existing entries is preserved unless it is easy
;to see that an entire range is being overwritten.  (This may mean spitting the
;entry in two or more pieces).  If a subrange is being stored of a previous range,
;the previous range must be split. it is stored as an exception.

;numeric key BTREEs versus string-key BTREEs.
;  could use only one set of routines for both.  However, it leads to cleaner
;  code to have top level routines duplicated (routines with * below).  Most of the
;  hair can be shared anyway.  The only below-top-level routine which has to test
;  is btree-insert-item.  (one reason for the duplication is ranges only apply
;  to the numeric-key case, but mess up the code for the string case quite a bit.)

;0  B-KEY data.  Divides array data into BTREE elements.
;(first 3)  range delta.   Preceeding key really applies to a range, this many (KEY itself
;       is the bottom of the range.)
;(second 3) subrange pointer.  Obtain trial "final association" from 2 item in this group.
;       This 3 data is a pointer to a BTREE structure which can map exceptions; if the

;1  lower btree node pointers.  Follow this if searched for data was LESS  or EQUAL
;       than preceeding key.  If present, this signals that this BTREE element is a

;2  FINAL-ASSOCIATION.  If searched for data is EQUAL to (or within range of) the preceeding
;       B-KEY, this is it!

;For efficiency, we impose a few restrictions on the ordering of the various frobs.
;  The B-KEY comes first.  other entries until next key apply to this key.

; We restrict range so as to avoid need to change any DIVISOR's range.
; Previously stored ranges are split, if necessary, to avoid partial overlaps.
;Returns:
; first, second values are segment being returned for "action".
; third value says what action is appropriate:
;    T says store this much.  Necessary deletes for storing yea much have been done.
;  DELETE says this segment is overlapped.  Delete it, and try again.
;      (can either be completely overlapped, or aligned at one edge of B-ENTRY, in which
;      case deletion can be effected by suitable storing on top of B-ENTRY edge, restricting
;      it.)
;  -- not used -- LEFT-EDGE says use left edge store for this.
;  NODE says limited by NODE mapping range.
;  If desired range is contained within previously stored range, not touching either edge,
;     This function will split it, and try again.
