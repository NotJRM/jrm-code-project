;;;; Basic File Operations
;;; Files come in four states:

;;; Nonexistent: an invalid state which should never be encountered.
;;; The storage associated with this state is FREE.

;;; Unclosed:  the normal state for newly-opened output files, it is
;;; indicated by the Closed bit being off.  The Deleted bit can be
;;; either on or off; when closed, the file retains that property.
;;; The storage associated with this state is RESERVED.

;;; Closed:  the normal state for existing files, it is indicated by the
;;; Closed bit being on and the Deleted bit being off.  The storage
;;; associated with this state is USED.

;;; Deleted:  a special state between closed and nonexistent, this is
;;; indicated by the Closed bit being on and the Deleted bit being on.
;;; The storage associated with this state is RESERVED.

;;; Logically, there should be these transition functions:

;;; Nonexistent <-> Unclosed
;;; Unclosed -> Closed
;;; Closed <-> Deleted
;;; Deleted -> Nonexistent

;;; However, the implementation is based on target states only.

;;; The locking strategy is:  lock a file first, then lock its directory.
;;; Never lock the file second.  There is only
;;; one case where two files need to be locked, and one of those is
;;; an Unclosed file; only one process should point to that file.

;;; Unclosed files are in the directory; however it is not possible
;;; to open them.  Deleted files are also in the directory, and can be opened.

;;; When a file is overwritten, it is left in the directory.
;;; It is made to point to the file which is overwriting it,
;;; and the overwriting file is made to point to the overwritten one also.
;;; It is possible to tell which is which on the basis of the closed bit.
;;; The overwritten file is closed, and the overwriting file isn't.

;mapped files
;  for now, an option to open, should it be a separate operation?
;  The :moby-mapped keyword specifies the file is not to be used for stream
;operations at all, but is to be moby-mapped.  This keyword can be used
;with :direction either :input or :output.
;  If a new file is to be created, the paired value of :moby-mapped
;controls the root generation of the new file.
;   if T -> the root is to be a CONS, and will be (cons nil nil) in the mapped area of the
;               new file
;   otherwise, the root is to be an array, and paired with :moby-mapped is an argument
;for MAKE-ARRAY to cons it.  THIS ARGUMENT SHOULD NOT INCLUDE A :AREA KEYWORD!

;The :moby-mapped keyword inhibits generation of any stream-like object.
;Instead, the FILE-ROOT is returnned as the value of MBFS-OPEN-FILE (thence :OPEN etc).
;  for stream-written files, the FILE-ROOT is a pointer to the ARRAY-OF-ARRAYS.
;   (the ARRAY-OF-ARRAYS is stored in the root-area, not the mapped area of the file).

;The following keywords set bits in area-moby-options  of the section map if a section
;   (ie file) is created.
;:write-once causes data in section to be freely distributed without dereconciling it locally.
;:double-mapped causes double-mapped dataspace pages to be used.  This provides additional
;  redundancy and allows "atomic" modifications.  (This will currently cause usage of
;  double-mapped space.  The "atomic" feature is nyi.)
