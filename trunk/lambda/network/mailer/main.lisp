;;;   Rpk, 8 July 1983: Works.  Delayed delivery implemented for more than
;;;      *DELAY-DELIVERY-THRESHOLD* (3 is the default).
;;;   RpK, 20 December 1984: Clean up for the modern world, customers.
;;;      Now it always queues...
;;;   RpK, 4 January 1985: Support Chaosnet. *delay-delivery* helps debugging
;;;   RpK, 8 January 1985: Be a real system.
