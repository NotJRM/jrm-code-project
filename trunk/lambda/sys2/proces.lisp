;;; Process system and scheduler

; A process is an instance which embodies one or several stack groups as well as
; appropriate variables to determine the stack-group's status and runnability.
; See PRODEF

;;; ACTIVE-PROCESSES    An alist of all processes that are runnable.
;;;                     A process is runnable if it has at least one run
;;;                     reason, and no arrest reasons.  This list is maintained
;;;                     because it is considered too expensive to have the
;;;                     scheduler inspect each process' run and arrest reasons.
;;; Each element on ACTIVE-PROCESSES looks like:
;;;     (process wait-function wait-arglist priority <slots for wait args>)
;;;     wait-arglist is usually a tail of this list
;;; CURRENT-PROCESS     The process that is currently running.  NIL inside the
;;;                     scheduler.
