;;; A hash table that the user sees is a flavor instance.
;;; The guts of it is a named-structure array defined below.

;;; The contents of the array is divided into n-word blocks.
;;; Each block corresponds to one hash key.  The first word of the block is the key.
;;; The remaining words are associated data.  Normally there is only one of them.
;;; Each key and its associated data words form a cdr-next list.
;;; The third value of GETHASH points to this list.
;;; Extra args to PUTHASH can be used to set data words past the first.

;;; A DTP-NULL is used in the table in the key position to mark an empty slot.
;;; DTP-NULL with nonzero pointer means a slot that was "deleted" and
;;; which search must continue past.

;;; A flavor's method hash table is actually the array, not the flavor instance.
;;; The array points to the flavor instance it belongs to, so that the
;;; flavor code can find the instance to send messages to it.
;;; This also enables flavors to be bootstrapped.

;;; This file defines only the low-level hash arrays.
;;; The file HASHFL, loaded after flavors are loaded,
;;; defines the hash table flavors and the user-level functions that work on them.

;;;; This page deals with defining and creating the hash arrays.

;;; NOTE: the microcode knows the index of HASH-ARRAY-MODULUS
;;;  as well as the organization of the entries and how to hash them,
;;;  in the special case that the modulus is a power of 2.
;;;  See label CALL-INSTANCE-ARRAY in the microcode.
