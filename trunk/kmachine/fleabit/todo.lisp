multiple-value-setq/bind (nil foo) ...
 common lisp doesn't allow this, but should complain about setqing/binding nil

try to remove spurious branches in simple optional args

do we need a memory-wait between MD-START-W and VMA-START-R with stack vars?
can stack slots be forwarded? (Read-will-write w/o sequence breaks)

declare

(setq p (foo p)) where p is setqed closed var seems to get dest of p in foo
 v and p in same pref class but p is closed env in (loc p)
   - put env-acc somewhere else?
   - make all pref-class have acc to (closure-ref ...
   - check if acc = *env-acc*

;;; Hey, Ed!  Can we have compiler errors such as
;;; "Foo is bound, but never used" because I am truly
