
  Substitution of Setqed Variables

is possible when the setq(s) are outside the extent
of the variable substituted for.

this is important for macros especially setf

  var not live at setqs
    requires live variable analysis which does not seem to work
    for thunked labels (Y) fixed! removed fixup! dehaired simplify-y!

    but it still doesn't work very well because strategy analysis
    (known variable) is not too reliable before simplification
    bogus STRATEGY/HEAP lambdas cause bogus closed properties

---

what about putting variables in same pref class?
criterion for coextant-p is now if one variable is live
in the extent of the other.  But if v1 bound to v2 and
v1 is not setqed and v2 is not setqed within extent

**************************************************
maybe this is over restrictive??
if y is bound to x then x and y are in same pref class
if z is also bound to x the we try to add z to pref class
 but z is not bound to y so can-be-same returns NIL

   must v1 be bound to v2??

(defun bletch (i)
  (labels ((foo (x))
             (bar i)
             (foo 5))
    (foo i)))

i and x must be distinct here

coextant-p:

v1 cannot be live and binding of v2 if v2-binder is STRATEGY/LABEL??

what we mean is: v1 cant be live at places where v2 can change.
v2 gets initialized at let binding but we wouldn't be trying to put
it in same class if that binding wasn't to v1 or equivalent

this seems to work, but target-var-to-var cant handle it because
the two vars are coextant even though that is ok.
