Notes on work done by Pace Willisson and Gill Pratt during the week
ending 7/29/88.

Our work was concentrated in two areas: fixing the time the transmitter
register is loaded, and designing a solution to the illegal connections
between the asynchronous receiver state machine, and the rest of the bus
coupler.
