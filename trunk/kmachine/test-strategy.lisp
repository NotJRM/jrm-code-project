The purpose of this document is to present an architectual overview of the
K-Processor, outline the K's functionality, and present a strategy for testing
this functionality.  The test strategy will be based upon an identification of
functional dependancies found in the K-Processor design.  Data paths used by
more than one function of the K-Processor will be tested first thereby providing
the basis for diagnosing the source of failure in a K-Processor that is not
fully functional.

                left and right versions for each register
                        (due to simulated two read one write port memory)
                frame and location (4K locations)
                three ways of accessing
                        global registers

Instruction Cache
        run first with cache off and statistics on
        run with each cache turned on seperately
                Page Zero cache
                A Cache
                B Cache
