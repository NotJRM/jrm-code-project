;;; This file provides some user functions to boot the K processor and
;;; download system files.
;;;
;;; The function (MEGA-BOOT) builds a new cold load, writes the cold load
;;; to the K processor, and boots the K processor.  Then it downloads the
;;; files on the user#:*warm-loaded-files* list.  Next, it runs the function
;;; (LISP-INTERNALS::WARM-BOOT) on the K processor, which initializes the
;;; package system and evaluator.  Finally, it downloads the files on the
;;; *hot-loaded-files* list.
;;;
;;; When supplied with a non-NIL optional argument, MEGA-BOOT does not
;;; build a new cold load.  Instead, it reuses the last one created.
;;;
;;; Each entry of user#:*warm-loaded-files* and user#:*hot-loaded-files* is either a string
;;; (the filename) or a list of two elements, the filename and a second value.
;;; This second value controls whether or not the corresponding KENV file should
;;; be loaded.  If it is true, or the entry is just a filename, then the KENV
;;; file is loaded on the lambda at the same time the KFASL file is loaded on
;;; the K processor.  If it is NIL, then the KENV file is suppressed.
;;;
;;; Note:  When the lambda is freshly booted, it needs to know what slot the K
;;; processor is in before MEGA-BOOT can be run.  The function which does this
;;; is (LAM:K-LOCAL-SETUP <slot>), where <slot> is the slot number of the K
;;; memory board (the one with the LED's)
;;;
