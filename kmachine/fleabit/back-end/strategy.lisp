;;;; Strategy Analysis
;;;
;;; Determine strategy for compiling a lambda node.
;;; There are four strategies:
;;;
;;; OPEN  - This lambda is a simple continuation, it is called
;;;         from a single place and returns to a single place.
;;;         It will turn into a piece of straight line code.
;;; LABEL - This lambda may be called from many places, but only has
;;;         one continuation, ie it always returns to the same place.
;;;         It can be a piece of inline code, but will need a label
;;;         which may be branched to.
;;; PROC  - This lambda is called from more than one place with different
;;;         continuations.  It needs to be an actual subroutine.  It is
;;;         always called and never used as an argument to any call and
;;;         therefore does not actually have to have an actual function
;;;         object associated with it, or be heap closed.
;;; HEAP  - This lambda is used as an argument to a call, and therefore
;;;         may persist indefinitly and be called with FUNCALL.  A function
;;;         object needs to be created and possibly a closure consed.
;;;
;;; The strategy analysis phase also computes the set of variables used
;;; within each lambda.  The used variables are the variables referenced
;;; within the lexical scope of the lambda.  This differs from the live
;;; variables which are referenced within the dynamic extent of the lambda.
;;; The used variables are needed for closure analysis.
;;; Variables which are used in strategy HEAP lambdas also have variable-closed
;;; set to T.

;;; This seems to be about as random a place to put this.
