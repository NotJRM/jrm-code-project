;;;  Optimization of CPS code tree

;;; Post-CPS code has these properties:
;;;   For every LAMBDA node L:
;;;     - L's body is a call.
;;;     - L's parent is a call, or else L is the top of the tree.
;;;   For every call node N:
;;;     - N's procedure and arguments are all non-calls.
;;;     - N's parent is a LAMBDA.

;;; (SIMPLIFY node-pair)
;;;============================================================================
;;;   Post-CPS optimizer.  All simplifications are done by changing the
;;; structure of the node tree.  NODE-PAIR is a pair whose CAR contains a
;;; leaf-node or a lambda-node.
;;;
;;; There are three requirements for the simplification procedures:
;;;    1) They must return T if the tree has been changed and NIL otherwise.
;;;    2) Only the node being simplified and its descendents may be changed.
;;;    3) If a node is changed the NODE-SIMPLIFIED? flag of that node and all
;;;       its ancestors must be set to NIL.
