Cold load

Load warm files
  Instantiate DEFVAR's with self-evaluating values.  Instantiate other
  DEFVAR's to unbound, push a SET form onto k2::*warm-eval-list*, and warn
  about the delayed evaluation.  Push EVAL-WHEN(LOAD) forms onto
  k2::*warm-eval-list* and warn about the delayed evaluation.

Warm boot
  Explicitly run warm files' initialization routines.  Includes: package
  system, streams.  This speeds up loading the hot files.

Load hot files
  Same restrictions on initialization as for warm files.

Hot boot
  Explicitly run hot files' initialization routines.  At this point, the
  evaluator is fully loaded.  Set k2::*evaluator-available?* to true.
  Evaluate the forms on k2::*warm-eval-list*.

Full FASL Loader
  Evaluate DEFVAR's and EVAL-WHEN(LOAD)'s at load time.
