There are 8,259,718 words of dynamic space, 388,945 words of static space, and
21,742,612 words of free space.  Free space consists of 19,431,424 words of unallocated
storage plus 1/2 of the 4,622,375 words of storage already allocated to specific
regions but not yet used.

Dynamic space storage distribution:
