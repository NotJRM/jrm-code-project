;This function is what may be used to properly perform some action within
; a file-plist binding.  It, by convention, defines the semantics of
; file-attribute-bindings.  Note the pathname should be a real pathname.
; Note that this function does not deal with how we get the plist, just how
; we use it.
;Each property name on the plist is examined for a
; fs:file-attribute-bindings property.  If such a property is present,
; it is funcalled on three arguments:  the pathname, the property
; name, and the property value.  It should return four values [the
; last two may be defaulted]:  a list of variables to bind, a list of
; values to bind them to, a list of initialization functions to call,
; and a list of cleanup functions to call.  For the duration of the
; "loading", the variables will be bound (dynamically) to the given
; values.  Inside that binding environment, the initialization
; functions will be called to perform any other non-binding or
; asynchronous setups that may be required.  (The calculation of the
; values happens outside of the unwind-protected scoping, but the
; calling of the init-functions does not.)  The exit-functions are
; treated identically to those functions in file-exit-functions.  They
; also are called within the binding scope.
;At this time it is not guaranteed that multiple values are passed
; back correctly.
