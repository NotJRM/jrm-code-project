  ;;Bit-vector is 1 for every self-inserting character. It should

  ;; Its use is for ECHOIN.
  ;;Bit-vector-valid? is used internally.
  ;;Alist is used internally. It is the alist of local binding definitions.
  ;; These are cached with the inherited definitions in CACHE.
  ;;Superior is the superior binding-table, or NIL.
  ;;Prefix-alist is an alist of Gensym atoms and binding tables.
  ;; A prefix-character binding contains a reference to a gensym atom,
  ;; and this is used to get to the binding table in the alist.
  ;; If the binding-table is not found in the alist the superiors are searched.
  ;; If it is found in a superior then that is the superior of the new
  ;; binding-table. Otherwise the new binding-table has no superior.
  ;; This is complicated, but I think the simplest robust scheme for
  ;; extensible and inheritable prefix-character bindings.
  ;; Notice in particular that
  ;; (editor-bind-key FOO (internal-editor-lookup-key #\control-x))
  ;; will work, and be inheritable. Also the binding of control-x could
  ;; be deleted or changed (even to be a new prefix-character).

;The prefix-character scheme is rather complex.
; It includes many levels of indirection to implement two principle features.
; (1) The binding definition of a prefix-character can be bound to any
;     other key and it will be the same prefix-character (using the same
;     subtable.) With some restriction this can be done even if the new
;     binding is done in a different mode. (The restriction is a scoping
;     restriction. The new binding must be in the original binding-table, or
;     one of its inferiors.) With this restriction it is unambiguous how
;     the subtable should inherit: it always inherits from some superior,
;     just as the original binding-table would.
; (2) Redefinining the binding of a two character command is always
;     scoped right. An inferior mode definition will shadow a superior
;     definition and a superior definition will be inherited by an inferior
;     binding-table unless it is shadowed. Again this is exactly the behavior
;     of single character binding definitions.
;
;Implementation.
;       The binding definition of a prefix character includes a gensym atom.
;       This identifies the original sub-table for that prefix-character.
;       Using this as a tag the sub-table is found by searching the
;       current binding-table and its superiors. The instance-variable
;       prefix-alist is used to store the sub-table. If the prefix-table
;       is found in a superior binding-table, then a new sub-table is
;       generated and added to the prefix-alist of the current binding-table.
;       The newly generated sub-table will have the original one as its
;       ultimate superior, so inheritance and shadowing can occur.
;
;      Binding a sub-command is done by finding or creating the correct
;       sub-table (as described above) and then binding the secondary
;       dispatch character in the sub-table.
;
;      Lookup is done by finding or creating the correct sub-table and
;       looking up the secondary dispatch character in the sub-table.
