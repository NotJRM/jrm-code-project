;the s-list is a list of strings. There is an implicit CR between

;The first clause in the AND in the THEREIS does NOT check to see
;if there are enough characters in the line. It checks to see if
;point is close enough to the end so that when the string S1 is
;matched to the suffix of the line, the beginning of the match is on or
;before point.
;The STRING-EQUAL checks that the suffixes match.

;matches, because the string-equal is placed so it assumes there
;is a CR after the first string in s-list, even though the definition above
;says that CRs are between strings. The bug is that there is an assumed CR
;after a s-list of length one, and the function above returns such s-lists.
