Documentation in /lmi/gjc/doc/gchan.botex
Also an extensive project notebook.

Bruce has support letter I wrote to IBM. Dont know status.
Also has expense report. Status?

Project will be complete when Command-Chaining question is resolved.
(Then short report with IBM on future possibilities. )
May take another trip to Rochester by myself and Middleton of Auscom.
Costs LMI about $1200 a day (not including my salary) to have us
out at Rochester. So working with IBM personel via phone to
help debug this. Also using FAX to send printouts of code and debug trace.
IBM people learning a lot about the LAMBDA doing this, so not great
preasure to resolve this via brute force.


   DOCUMENTATION SUPPORT

Have DVI preview program working. Generates IMPRESS for IMAGEN also.
Working on screen-dump (PAINT) inclusion in documents for Dawna.
Need help from RPK to move latest botex to VMS VAX which would be
a good BOTEX server.


  EXPLORER, LAMBDA-E, MIT

new lmi debug board in LAMBDA-2 and EXP1.
Kent showed me cable hookup. SPI code in dj:bobp;
Other code (NUBUS) in sys:lambda-diag;
Must integrate this in lambda diag, probably system 116 version.
 Problems: basic problem with network code. Nubus timeouts in
           access to ethernet board that TI doesnt have.
           Looking at how TI does it to find out whats wrong.
           WRITE-INTERNAL-PROCESSOR-MEMORIES needed for incremental microassembler.
           Tape stuff well in hand at Chapparel Dallas.


  WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB
Code in DJ:ATN-TASC-WILBUR; gets error on demo. Looks like
problem in demo file itself, inconsistent with rule base in NODES.LISP.
July 23 date for demo including communication with fortran code on 68010.
 Problem: WPAFB side itself is wimpy. Want turn-key demo. Not putting any
 effort into understanding the code itself. Needs to be resolved with
 supervisory persons at WPAFB.


 CARNEGIE GROUP

Chance to get off on the right foot with a good software supplier/house.
Main issue will be speed since compatibility issues are well in hand.
Did have to fix quite a few system bugs last time guy from Carnegie was
at LMI. But he fix half of them himself. Probable two days mid july
in Pittsburg.



  TCP-IP

Late july expect new NET/download module from Excelan. Should work with
CHAOS/TCP at same time. Need more excelan boards to test this out.
Problem: Need to do TCP in lisp for new product.
Helen not much help in fixing lisp bugs. Roger extremely slow
going on learning system. Bad situation.
Unix TCP: going ok. Maybe can teach wolfgang enough lisp so
he can implement the lisp side of an excelan sharing protocol?
Maybe will have to go for the two-board situation for MCC HI group.


 GENERAL NETWORKING
Need work on TELNET type interfaces. Unification of user side. General
server capability. RMS worked on ZMACS other-window display for
using ZMACS from network.



  TIMESHARING/ENVIRONMENTS

System 116 has data type. Need to write 10 lines of microcode for
DTP-INDEXED-FORWARD then lisp support for MAKE-ENVIRONMENT
and kludges in package system for automatic environment management.
Testbed: DOE-MACSYMA




  RPC XDR NFS for SUN

Did a bit of XDR, but could get XDR RPC from Glenn at Lincoln Labs
in exchange for NFS on top of it. Simple enough though that
probably better to do myself, avoid various issues.
Problem: Configure sun with NFS stuff in it.
Excelan board in more machines to debug from/to.
