; "Microprogramming is a wasteland of time and too dependent on
;       the technology of implementation."  --Gordon Bell

(DEFCONST UC-PARAMETERS  '(

;Notes re the ERROR-TABLE pseudo-op:
;  If the error list contains the symbol CALLS-SUB, the entry serves only
;to mark an interesting item for the user on the micro-stack.  Accordingly,
;the entry should be positioned to match with whats on the stack at the time of
;the error. In particular, it should be after the following instruction in case of
;CALL-XCT-NEXT, etc.  No EHS- properties or routines are associated in this case.
;  Otherwise, the entry is intended to match with trap location saved at location
;TRAP.  In this case it should also come after an XCT-NEXT'ed instruction if there is any.
;  These entries (may well)
;coordinate with error recovery/printout routines in LMWIN;EHR >.  So check
;EHR when making changes in the vicinity of an ERROR-TABLE which does not
;have a CALLS-SUB.  In particular, if the ERROR-TABLE entry is proceedable or to be made
;proceedable, make sure relevant quantities are all held in ACs that get saved
;(M-A, etc) as opposed to ones that dont (M-3, A-TEM1 etc).

;  To mark a point in the code to which proceed-routines may want to go,
;put an (ERROR-TABLE RESTART <name>) BEFORE the instruction.  <name> is any
;arbitrary symbol that does not conflict with any other used.

;Notes re the MC-LINKAGE pseudo-op:
; This mechanism provides linkage between microcompiled code and the main ULOAD.
;You say (MC-LINKAGE (<SYM> ..)) and the address within memory and memory of <SYM>s will
;be available to the microcompiled code loader and/or the assembler operating in incremental
;mode.  If the list element is non-atomic, CAR is the microcompiled symbol, CADR the UCADR
;symbol. Currently, this info is transferred via an entry in the assembler state written
;at the beginning of the SYM file, but it will probably be moved to the TBL file
;eventually.  All A or M memory symbols with values less than 40 are automatically
;MC-LINKAGEified.
;  As a consequence of this mechanism, all microcompiler "dependancy links"
;go through MISC-INST-ENTRYs or MC-LINKAGEs.  The main symbol table is not required.
