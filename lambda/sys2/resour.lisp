;;;NOTE: The is quite a bit of confusion in terminlogy below wrt "FREE-LIST".
;;;  When the old code and documentation says FREE-LIST, it really means "Array which holds
;;;  all instances in existance.  Another component of the array has a flag which records
;;;  which instances are really free, etc".  The new FREE-LIST-CELL option indicates
;;;  that a new-style real (chained) free list is in use.

;;; New version of resource package, subsumes system-window facility
;;; Note that WITH-RESOURCE is obsolete because it takes its "arguments"
;;; in the wrong order.  It has been replaced by USING-RESOURCE.

;;; Old form of DEFRESOURCE:
;;;     (DEFRESOURCE [name | (name dont-make-initial-copy)] . creator-body)
;;; New form of DEFRESOURCE:
;;;     (DEFRESOURCE name parameters [docstring] keyword value keyword value ...)
;;;  Keywords are:
;;;     :CONSTRUCTOR form   (this is required)
;;;             Sees parameters as arguments.
;;;     :FINDER form
;;;             Sees resource-structure and parameters as arguments.
;;;     :MATCHER form
;;;             Sees OBJECT (in current package) and parameters as arguments.
;;;             Note that if the FREE-LIST-CELL option is in use, :MATCHER must be
;;;             supplied unless there are no parameters.
;;;     :CHECKER form
;;;             Sees OBJECT and IN-USE-P (in current package) and parameters as arguments.
;;;     :INITIALIZER form
;;;             Sees OBJECT and parameters as arguments.
;;;       In the above options starting with :CONSTRUCTOR, form may also be a symbol
;;;       which is a function to call.  It gets the resource data structure as its first
;;;       argument then the specified args.
;;;     :DEINITIALIZER form
;;;             Sees OBJECT as argument.  This was initially added to preserve storage
;;;             integrity and avoid unnecessary data retention by the GC, by storing NILs
;;;             into boxed Qs when an object was deallocated.  SI:WIPE-STRUCTURE is a
;;;             general function for setting all slots of a structure to NIL.
;;;     :FREE-LIST-CELL form
;;;        Giving this option specifies that objects are to be chained in a "real" free
;;;        list instead of the funny array otherwise used.
;;;             Sees OBJECT as argument.   Returns locative pointer to a cell (presumably
;;;             withing OBJECT) which is to be used for free-list chaining.
;;;        Note that the :MATCHER option should be used with the :FREE-LIST-CELL option
;;;        unless parameters is always to be NIL.  This is due to the fact the parameters are not
;;;        retained in the resource data structure for EQUAL testing as a default :MATCHER.
;;;      In the above two options, form may also be a symbol which is a function to call.
;;;      However, the args are always as specified; the resource data structure is never passed.
;;;     :INITIAL-COPIES number  (default 0)
;;;             If this is specified, all parameters must be &optional and
;;;             have suitable defaults.  This is generally a good idea anyway.
;;;             Specifying NIL here is the same as zero.
;;;     :FREE-LIST-SIZE number  (default 20.)
;;;             If this is specified, the size of the free-list for this resource
;;;             will initially be that number.
;;;  If :FINDER is specified, we keep no list of free objects and use :FINDER
;;;  to find a free one by looking through the general environment.
;;;  Otherwise we keep a table of objects and whether they are free.
;;;  If :MATCHER is specified, we use it to check them against the parameters.
;;;  Otherwise the a-list also includes the parameter values, which are checked
;;;  with EQUAL (not EQ).
;;;  If :CHECKER is specified, then it gets to pass on each object to decide whether
;;;  or not to reuse it, whether or not it is already marked as in-use.
;;;
;;;  The finder, matcher, and checker are called without-interrupts.
;;;
;;;  Possible features that might be added: ability to keep a free list threaded
;;;  through the objects.  Code to be run when something is deallocated, e.g.
;;;  to deactivate a window.
;;;
;;;  Note: for windows, you typically want to use DEFWINDOW-RESOURCE,
;;;  which supplies the right options to DEFRESOURCE.
;;;
;;; DEFRESOURCE no longer uses the value and function cells of the resource's name.
;;; It puts on a DEFRESOURCE property of the following defstruct.  Note: only the
;;; functions right here are "allowed" to know what is in this structure.
