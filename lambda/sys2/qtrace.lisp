(DEFMACRO TRACE (&REST SPECS)
  "Turn on the tracing of one or more functions.  When a function is
traced, certain actions are taken when it is called and when it returns.
The default tracing action is to print a message when the function is
called, showing its name and arguments, and another message when the
function returns, showing its name and value(s).

Example:

(trace foo)

Note that FOO is not quoted.

TRACE takes a number of options.  Here is an example in which the
function FOO is traced with the options :step and :wherein:

     (trace (foo :step :wherein bar))

More Examples:

(trace ((foo bar) :break (bad-p arglist) :value))

(trace (:function (:method flavor :message) :break t))


Following are the possible options and what they do.

:BREAK pred - Causes a breakpoint to be entered after printing the entry
trace information but before applying the traced function to its
arguments, if and only if pred evaluates to non-nil.  During the
breakpoint, the symbol ARGLIST is bound to a list of the arguments of
the function.

:EXITBREAK pred - This is like break except that the breakpoint is
entered after the function has been executed and the exit trace
information has been printed, but before control returns.  During the
breakpoint, the symbol ARGLIST is bound to a list of the arguments of
the function, and the symbol VALUES is bound to a list of the values
that the function is returning.

:ERROR -  Causes the error handler to be called when the function is
entered.  Use RESUME (or CTRL-C) to continue execution of the function.

:STEP - Causes the function to be single-stepped whenever it is
called.

:STEPCOND pred - Causes the function to be single-stepped only if pred
evaluates to non-nil.

:ENTRYCOND pred - Causes trace information to be printed on function
entry only if pred evaluates to non-nil.

:EXITCOND pred - Causes trace information to be printed on function exit
only if pred evaluates to non-nil.

:COND pred - Specifies both EXITCOND and ENTRYCOND together.

:WHEREIN function - Causes the function given to TRACE to be traced only
when it is called, directly or indirectly, from the function given to
:wherein.  You can give several trace specs to TRACE, all specifying the
same function but with different :wherein options, so that the function
is traced in different ways when called from different functions.

:ARGPDL pdl - Specifies a symbol pdl, whose value is initially set to
nil by TRACE.  When the function is traced, a list of the current
recursion level for the function, the function's name, and a list of
arguments is consed onto the pdl when the function is entered, and
cdr'ed back off when the function is exited.  The pdl can be inspected
from within a breakpoint and used to determine the very recent history
of the function.

:ENTRYPRINT form - Evaluates form and includes its value in the trace
message for calls to the function.

:EXITPRINT form - Evaluates form and includes its value in the trace
message returned from the function.

:PRINT form - Evaluates form and includes its value in the trace
messages for both calls to and returns from the function.  Equivalent to
EXITPRINT and ENTRYPRINT at once.

:ENTRY list - Specifies a list of arbitrary forms whose values are to be
printed along with the usual entry-trace.  The list of resultant values,
when printed, is preceded by \\ to separate it from the other
information.

:EXIT list - Similar to :entry, but specifies expressions whose values
are printed with the exit-trace.  Again, the list of values printed is
preceded by \\.

:ARG :VALUE :BOTH NIL - These specify which of the usual trace printouts
should be enabled.  If :arg is specified, then on function entry the
name of the function and the values of its arguments will be printed.
If :value is specified, then on function exit the returned value(s) of
the function will be printed.  If :both is specified, both of these will
be printed.  If nil is specified, neither will be printed.  If none of
these four options are specified the default is to :both.  If any
further options appear after one of these, they are not treated as
options! Rather, they are considered to be arbitrary forms whose values
are to be printed on entry and/or exit to the function, along with the
normal trace information.  The values printed will be preceded by a //,
and follow any values specified by :entry or :exit.  Note that since
these options ``swallow'' all following options, if one is given it
should be the last option specified.

When called with no arguments, TRACE returns a list of all
function-specs traced.  When you are finished tracing a function, you
must untrace it with the function UNTRACE.

If you prefer a menu interface for turning on a trace, you can use any
of the following:

      The function TV:TRACE-VIA-MENUS.

      The TRACE option on the System Menu.

      The ZMACS command META-X TRACE."
