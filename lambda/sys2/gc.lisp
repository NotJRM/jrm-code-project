;;;; WITHOUT-FLIPPING (and GC locking strategy in general):

;;; We need to be able to defer flipping on several occasions.  MAPHASH and related operations
;;; traverse hash-tables in a non-standard way that gets confused by rehashing.  There may be
;;; a need to defer flipping during certain critical sections, to maintain storage
;;; consistency.  There may also be a need to defer flipping during some response-time
;;; critical section.
;;;
;;; To implement a without-flipping lock under multiprocessing conditions, we use the tried
;;; and true counter method.  To inhibit flipping, *INHIBIT-FLIPPING-COUNT* is incremented.
;;; Flipping is deferred at the lowest level, %FLIP, until the count gets down to zero again.
;;; (If it doesn't happen soon enough, %FLIP starts moaning about not being allowed to flip.)
;;; For debugging purposes, it is desirable to be able to find those processes which have
;;; incremented *INHIBIT-FLIPPING-COUNT*.  We do this by lambda-binding the variable
;;; *THIS-PROCESS-IS-INHIBITING-FLIPPING* to T in such stack groups. Then SYMEVAL-IN-STACK-GROUP
;;; can be used to find them.
;;;
;;; The actual flip is done without-interrupts, so locking is pretty easy.  The primary
;;; concerns are:
;;;
;;;   [] Nobody can flip while oldspace exists, until it is reclaimed.
;;;
;;;   [] Nobody can flip while ( *inhibit-flipping-count* 0); they should wait for this
;;;      to become true, then flip.  If flipping is inhibited for an extended period of
;;;      time, the user should be notified that the GC is in trouble.
;;;
;;;   [] Nobody should flip on the basis of obsolete information (if you make a decision
;;;      to flip, and then someone else flips before you do, then your decision should be
;;;      re-evaluated).
;;;
;;;   [] We should allow interrupts as much as possible.  The one exception I make is
;;;      for %FLIP, in which the lengthy microcode setup time and the initial burst of
;;;      transporter activity effectively defer interrupts a lot more than the explicit
;;;      without-interrupts.
;;;
;;;   [] Just because somebody is doing WITHOUT-FLIPPING shouldn't prevent somebody else
;;;      from deciding whether or not they want to flip.  WITHOUT-FLIPPING should only
;;;      come into effect once they have decided that they do, indeed, want to flip.
;;;
;;; In view of all this, the following idiom is used:
;;;
;;;    (when (null *gc-status*)                               ;Don't do anything if GC busy.
;;;      (let ((generation %gc-generation-number))            ;Record for later comparison.
;;;        ... decide whether to flip ...
;;;        (when (... I want to flip ...)
;;;          (without-interrupts
;;;            ;; Somebody else might have flipped before we got into the without-interrupts,
;;;            ;; so we have to check again to make sure that a) the GC is idle, and b) nobody
;;;            ;; has flipped/scavenged/reclaimed, incrementing the generation number.
;;;            (if (and (null *gc-status*)                    ;GC is still idle.
;;;                     (= generation %gc-generation-number)  ;Our decision is current.
;;;                     (%flip ... arguments ...))            ;%FLIP returns T if it flips.
;;;                I flipped!
;;;              else somebody else flipped -- try again)))))
;;;
;;; Note the behavior of %FLIP.  %FLIP ensures that flipping is not inhibited, waiting
;;; (impatiently) if it is.  If %FLIP actually does condemn some storage (its arguments
;;; could specify that nothing needs to be flipped), it atomically sets all the right
;;; variables to communicate its action and returns T, otherwise it just returns NIL.
;;;>> Note that the above is not really adequate!!!
;;;>>  For example, you could decide that you have to flip level 2, and then another process
;;;>>  flips level 3 (incrementing %gc-generation-number) which would make the above code
;;;>>  fragment believe that its job had been done by somebody else.
;;;>>>>  I'm not saying the job has been done by somebody else.  I'm saying the other process
;;;>>>>  changed the state of the world so much that the current process should reevaluate
;;;>>>>  its decision.  Part of the motivation for this reevaluation is that levels are not
;;;>>>>  independent -- level 2 includes level 3 and so forth.  If %FLIP returns NIL, then
;;;>>>>  you basically haven't the slightest idea what happened, and you're supposed to
;;;>>>>  investigate the situation further if you care (some callers, such as stupid humans,
;;;>>>>  may not).
;;;>> Even watching for a change in the appropriate element of *gc-flip-generations* is
;;;>>  still not entirely good enough, as somebody may flip at your level, but not flip
;;;>>  the area(s) upon which your calculations are based.
;;;
;;; RECLAIM-OLDSPACE is a bit simpler.  You call it to scavenge incrementally or batch.  If
;;; incremental, you wait until the scavenge is done.  If batch, you scavenge until the
;;; scavenge is done.  Then you go without-interrupts, see if oldspace still exists (someone
;;; might have beat you to it), and, if it does, reclaim it.  The result of all this is that
;;; any number of processes may call RECLAIM-OLDSPACE at a time, with exactly the same
;;; results as a single call.  Like %FLIP, RECLAIM-OLDSPACE returns T if your invocation
;;; actually did some work, NIL if someone else did it first.  In any case, any particular
;;; invocation of RECLAIM-OLDSPACE will not return until oldspace is reclaimed, whether by
;;; it or by someone else.

;;; [] Confessions:
;;;
;;;    I used Macsyma to solve for N.  Better safe than studly.
;;;
;;; [] Differences between this and the previous computation:
;;;
;;;    There is very little absolutely static space in the system, so we assume all new
;;;    storage consed during scavenging goes into newspace, which is not scavenged.  This
;;;    is a slightly optimistic assumption.  (this has been promoted to a Problem, below)
;;;
;;;    Not all dynamic space gets flipped, only the volatile portion.  Dynamic space that
;;;    is not flipped is considered static (for the duration of the flip) and must be
;;;    scavenged.
;;;
;;;    All decisions regarding flipping are made on the basis of the current committed
;;;    free space.  The ability to predict when a flip may happen is for user enlightenment
;;;    only.
;;;
;;;    We always assume that all storage will survive a flip.  As the computations get
;;;    more critical (for long low-volatility flips), this gets closer to true, since
;;;    objects there have already survived several flips.  I have no problems with this.
;;;
;;;    "Free space" is defined as the amount of storage not assigned to any region.  Storage
;;;    assigned to regions but not yet used is theoretically free, but may not be usable.
;;;    (quantums at the end of regions to be condemned will be deallocated and could safely
;;;    be regarded as free).
;;;
;;; [] Problems:
;;;
;;;    New storage allocated directly in lower-volatility regions (due to low-volatility
;;;    areas) is needlessly scavenged.  This is not represented in the equations, and I
;;;    don't think it should be.  The right way to deal with this is not to scavenge those
;;;    portions of "static" space that were allocated after a flip, using a per-region
;;;    table to indicate to the scavenger where to stop.  (This would be pretty easy for
;;;    the scavenger, since the part that deals with "am I done with this region yet"
;;;    is isolated.)

;;; Fudge factors for storage fragmentation, variable scavenging rates, and safety margin.
;;; Note that the localizer is a huge first-order fudge factor in itself -- it effectively
;;; scavenges all of copyspace, and the scavenger really only scavenges static space.
;;; Perhaps there is some reasonable way to determine these empirically?

Most of the statistics are kept on a per-level basis, so both the per-level

RECLAMATION RATIO: the percentage of condemned storage made available for reuse.
COST PER WORD RECLAIMED: microseconds of processor time spent to make one word
   of storage available for reuse.  There are many variables in this computation,
   and indeed the basic algorithm requires time proportional to the number of words
   NOT reclaimed, but it does give a rough idea of overall GC efficiency.
ACTIVE PROCESSOR UTILIZATION: the percentage of processor time used by the

TOTAL PROCESSOR UTILIZATION: the percentage of processor time used by the
   garbage collector since cold boot.

Statistics aren't recorded on Explorers, because I'm not willing to write the

;;; Object hashing

;;; This is a quick way of implementing weak pointers.
;;; (OBJECT-HASH frob) returns an integer.  This integer may be fed to
;;; OBJECT-UNHASH to yield the frob.  If, however, all pointers to the
;;; frob were dropped in-between hashing and unhashing, then OBJECT-UNHASH
;;; has the option of yielding nil (i.e. objects in the hash table will go
;;; away after a garbage collect if no one else points to them).

;;; While this implementation of weak pointers is nowhere near as flexible as
;;; some implementations, it is a good quick working hack.

;;; The *OBJECT->HASH-NUMBER-TABLE* holds the hash numbers keyed by the fixnum
;;; addresses of the objects.  Hashing the same (eq) object twice yields the same
;;; number.

;;; The *HASH-NUMBER->OBJECT-TABLE* holds the data types and the fixnum addresses
;;; of the objects keyed by the hash number.  This is so we can invert the mapping.

;;; After a GC, but before the reclaim, we scavenge the object tables and relink
;;; the addresses of any object which has been moved by the GC.  We drop the links to
;;; objects in oldspace.

;;; During a GC, the keys slowly become invalid.  This makes it impossible to hash
;;; off the keys.  We therefore do a linear search through the table validating and
;;; considering each key.  This is rather slow and it seems that the GC may often finish
;;; before we finish the scan.  Therefore, each step around the scan, we check to see if
;;; the GC is done.  If it is, we do the fast hash.

;;; The GC process is also locked out in a complicated way by using WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS in
;;; strategic places.  This ensures atomicity in searches.
