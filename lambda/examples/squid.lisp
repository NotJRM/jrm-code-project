SQUID - Self QUoting Internal Datum (Name from PDP-10 Maclisp) -GJC

In the interpreter, this form will eval itself and the result will
remain quoted forever after.

In the compiler, this says that the form is to be evaluated at load
time and that its result is to be used in all computations.

A few people have asked how to get load-time evaluations to happen, so
here it is. (This is used in Object-Lisp(TM) for example).
