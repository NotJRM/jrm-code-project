  "Compute the motion that would be caused by outputing a string.
This is used by the editor and by TV:STREAM-MIXIN.
In computing the motion, it will chose the font in one of two ways:
 If given an ART-FAT-STRING array (16 bit string) like the editor uses,
  it will take the font from the CHAR-FONT field of the
  character, and look in SHEET's font-map.
 If given an ART-STRING array (8 bit string), it will take the font from
  FONT, or the SHEET-CURRENT-FONT of the sheet.
SHEET is used to supply information such as the font map,
 and for defaulting such things as BOTTOM-LIMIT, RIGHT-LIMIT
 and LINE-HT.
STRING, with START and END, specifies what characters to process.
CR-AT-END-P if non-NIL says /"output/" a Return after
 STRING or the portion of STRING, and count that
 in the cursor motion.
STOP-X and STOP-Y specify a cursor position at which to stop.
 Processing stops when both coordinates are  the stop points.
 The stop points default to the bottom left corner of SHEET.
 Specify a very large value for STOP-Y if you do not
 want processing to stop before the end of STRING.
BOTTOM-LIMIT and RIGHT-LIMIT are a cursor position
 at which to wrap around; these default to
 the inside-size of SHEET.
FONT specifies the font to use, if STRING is not a fat string.
LINE-HT is the line height to use for Return characters,
 defaulting to SHEET's line height.
TAB-WIDTH is the width to use for Tab characters,
 defaulting to SHEET's SHEET-TAB-WIDTH.

Processing stops either because the string or portion has
been processed or because the stopping-point has been reached.

Returns 4 values:
FINAL-X, FINAL-Y are the cursor position
 at which processing stopped.
FINAL-STRING-INDEX is the index
 in the string at which processing stopped (could be the length
 of the string, if the stop point was passed then), T if stopped
 due to reaching the stop point after the additional Return,
 or NIL if stopped due to finishing.
MAXIMUM-X was the largest X-position ever encountered during processing."
