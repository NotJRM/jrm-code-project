#|
A tool is a metaphor for a mode.  A user picks a tool from a toolbox menu and
uses it to perform some operation on display (usually on a specific objects).
Picking up a tool changes the mouse icon and the mouse sensitivity: only objects
that the tool can act on are sensitive.

To make the interface more flexible, the user can mouse on an object and get a
pop-up menu of tools.  This corresponds to a noun-verb grammer rather than the
verb-noun grammer of modes.

Implementation:  a tool is an object...
