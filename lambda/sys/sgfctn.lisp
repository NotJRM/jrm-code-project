Keywords allowed are:
:SG-AREA - specify area to cons in; default is DEFAULT-CONS-AREA.
:REGULAR-PDL-SIZE - size of regular pdl in Qs; default is #o3000.
:SPECIAL-PDL-SIZE - size of special pdl in Qs; default is #o2000.
:TRAP-ENABLE - NIL or 0 means halt on error in this stack group.
  Default is T, meaning to enter the debugger.
:SAFE - NIL or 0 means allow stack group switching in any order.
The last two keywords can be either 1 vs 0 or T vs NIL.
:REGULAR-PDL-AREA - Ignored, always PDL-AREA.
:SPECIAL-PDL-AREA - Ignored, always SPECIAL-PDL-AREA.
Other keywords are obscure and not needed."
