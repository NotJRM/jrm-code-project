;;; each breakoff function where to find its variables.  Unfortunately, we locate variables
;;; by assq and find-position-in-list.  If two variables have the same name, it will find
;;; the one furthest up on the list.
#| Example:

(defvar *loser-1*)
(defvar *loser-2*)

(defun foo-loser (a b)
  (let ((a 'local-a))
    (setq *loser-1*

  (let ((b 'local-b))
    (setq *loser-2*
          #'(lambda () (format t "~%A = ~S, B = ~S" a b)))))

|#
;;; After calling foo-loser, if you funcall *loser-1* it will report that a and b are
;;; 'local-a and 'local-b respectively.  The internal lambdas never even see the arguments.
;;; The most straightforward way to fix this would be to cons the *vars* to the
;;; *outer-context-vars* in breakoff.  This would work except that now, instead of finding the
;;; wrong name in the alist, we find the right name in the wrong position
;;; and make a lexical reference to a completly random spot.
;;;

;;; The solution: We tag lexical closures in the compiler queue as
;;; before, but we also include a list of lexically visible variables.
;;; When it comes time to RECORD-VARIABLES-USED-IN-LEXICAL-CLOSURES
;;; (which informs each closure on the compilation queue of the higher
;;; context), instead of giving the complete context to the closure, we
;;; replace the variables that are not visible with gensyms so that
;;; using find-position-in-list will not find an incorrect variable with
;;; the same name or a correct name in the wrong position in the list.

We create this:

 The permutation table gets filled with the index of each specified
 keyword in the list of allowed keywords, and then it is used to
 permute the args, rather than looking up the keywords again.
 The leader of the permutation table records the fef that the table
 was computed for.  If the function definition changes, the table
 is recomputed).
