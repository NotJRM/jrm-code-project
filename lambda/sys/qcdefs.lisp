;open frames, buffering intermediate values, and multiple values in cross-compile mode:
; (1)  We dont have a stack to buffer things, so we use call frames allocated specifically for the purpose
;   to hold things.  That works pretty well, but we actually have to call a function (usually prog1-internal)
;   to eventually get rid of it (them).
; (2)  thus, open frames are used for the following purposes:
;      (a)  The "main" one, to hold evaluated args while prepareing a function call (P2ARGC-FOR-K)
;      (b)  P2PROG12N-FOR-K (open this out just to sop up any number of args).
;the mechanism for keeping track of things is *open-frames*, which is a list of open-frame structures.
;*open-frames* works stack-wise, ie, it should always be at the same level when entering as when leaving
;functions like P2-for-K, P2ARGC-FOR-K, etc.
;the timing is:
;  the entry gets put on when the "logical" open is about to be output.  This is just before K:CH-OPEN, etc,
;    in usual case, but can be substantually before in case of k:new-open, etc.  This is necessary
;    to assure the stackwise property.
;  when the code which creates the frame is recognized at OUTI-FOR-K, (either the K:CH-OPEN or K:NEW-OPEN)
;    the frame is marked as THERE-P.
;  At P2ARGC-FOR-K, when all args are "loaded", it does a OUTI-CLOSE-FOR-K, when "sends" a NIL message to the
;    frame, which outputs the activating code (K:CALL or K:TAIL-CALL).
;  when the code which activates the frame is recognized (K:CALL OR K:TAIL-CALL),  FINISH-OPEN-FRAME is called,
;    which pops *open-frames*. Then, if a return is involved, the value is generated to k:o0 and a clean-up-open-frames
;    in mode :RETURN is invoked, followed by OUTPUT-FULL-EXIT-SEQUENCE, followed by returnning k:o0.
;  This latter also happens if a K:MOVE to a *return-destination* is encountered.

;K:OPEN operations should always be output as separate instructions.  K:OPEN-CALL, K:CH-OPEN, etc, should never
;  be directly output.  This simplifies OUTI-FOR-K, and POSTPROCESS optimizes them well.

;Calling p2-for-k and p2-mv-for-k.
;  if you want multiple-values, *m-v-target* gets bound to the "instruction" for the lower guys.
;  For the lambda, if *m-v-target* is non-null, DEST was always D-PDL.  It is then possible that
;   the lower guy either "sees" the instruction or not.  If so, *m-v-target* is set to NIL.  Otherwise,
;   if it was left alone, the lower level really didnt do anything at all special vis-a-vis multiple-values.
