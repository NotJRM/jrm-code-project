;;; It doesn't actually compile or evaluate anything,

;;;  a form to process, and a flag which is one of these atoms:
;;;   SPECIAL  -  QC-FILE should eval this and put it in the FASL file.
;;;             UNDO-DECLARATIONS-FLAG, if on, should stay on for this.
;;;   DECLARE  -  QC-FILE should eval this.
;;;   PROCLAIM -  Hair.
;;;               More Recent Historical Note:
;;;                  As of system 124, PROCLAIM forms were only being done at
;;;                  compile-time.  COMPILE-PROCLAIM now calls the compiler user's
;;;                  processing function.  For compile-file, this means that a
;;;                  form gets in the fastload-file to evaluate the PROCLAIM form.
;;;                  We also taught ZWEI:COMPILE-BUFFER-FORM to handle PROCLAIM
;;;                  like SPECIAL.  *** Keith and PLD, 6/24/88
;;;   DEFUN    -  QC-FILE should compile this and put the result in the FASL file.
;;;   MACRO    -  This defines a macro.  QC-FILE should record a declaration
;;;                and compile it into the FASL file.
;;;   RANDOM   -  QC-FILE should just put this in the FASL file to be evalled.
;;; Of course, operations other than QC-FILE will want to do different things
;;; in each case, but they will probably want to distinguish the same cases.
;;; That's why COMPILE-DRIVER will be useful to them.

;;; If it returns T, nothing more is done to the form.  If it returns NIL,
