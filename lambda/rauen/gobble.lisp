;;; GOBBLE.LISP
;;;
;;; Takes two arguments:
;;;    List of forms to gobble
;;;    Flag indicating whether or not to gobble documentation strings too
;;;
;;; Returns three values:
;;;    Body (forms after declarations and documentation strings)
;;;    List of declarations
;;;    Documentation string (if applicable)
;;;
;;; Weird cases, if gobble-doc-strings-too:
;;;    If there is more than one string in the forms, the second string and
;;;       everything following it (including declarations) are part of the body.
;;;    If the body is null, and a documentation string is present, a list
;;;       containing the documentation string is the body.
;;;    These cases follow from a strict interpretation of decl-spec/doc-string
;;;    syntax described in Common Lisp.
;;;
;;; Macroexpand is used to handle the obnoxious case of macros which expand into
;;;    declarations or documentation strings.
