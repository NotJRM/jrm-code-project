and the innermost resume handler for that keyword which is applicable to the
condition being handled will be run.  It is supposed to do a throw.
Elements of this list look like
 (CONDITION-NAMES KEYWORD PREDICATE (FORMAT-STRING FORMAT-ARGS...) HANDLER EXTRA-ARGS...).
CONDITION-NAMES is a condition name or list of such, or NIL.
 This is as for CONDITION-HANDLERS.
KEYWORD is the resume-type.
PREDICATE is called with one argument, the condition,
 and if the result is non-NIL, this handler is active for this condition.
 PREDICATE can be T, meaning handler is always active if CONDITION-NAMES match.
FORMAT-STRING and FORMAT-ARGS are used to print a message saying what
 this resume handler is intended for.
HANDLER is what to do if the debugger actually says to use this resume handler.
EXTRA-ARGS are passed to HANDLER, after the condition object which is its first arg.
Any additional values returned from the condition handler or from
the :PROCEED-ASKING-USER operation (not including the proceed-type)
are also passed to HANDLER, following the EXTRA-ARGS.

An element can also be just T, which means don't look past here when
looking for a resume handler for an unhandled SIGNAL on a non-error condition.")
