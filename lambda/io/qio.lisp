;;; Naming conventions:
;;;   Symbols whose names end in "-INPUT", "-OUTPUT", or "-IO" should
;;;      normally be BOUND to streams; which of the three you use depends on
;;;      what directions the stream normally supports.
;;;   Symbols whose names end in "-STREAM" are DEFINED as streams.


;;; Synonyms.
;;; MAKE-SYNONYM-STREAM takes a symbol, and returns a stream which will forward all operations
;;;   to the binding of the symbol.  After (SETQ BAR (MAKE-SYNONYM-STREAM 'FOO)), one says
;;;   that BAR is SYNned to FOO.


;;; The initial environment.
;;;   The initial binding of streams (set up by LISP-REINITIALIZE) is
;;;      as follows:
;;;   *TERMINAL-IO*     - This is how to get directly to the user's terminal.  It is set
;;;                     up to go to the TV initially.  Other places it might go are to
;;;   *STANDARD-INPUT*  - This is initially bound to SYN to *TERMINAL-IO*.
;;;   *STANDARD-OUTPUT* - This is initially bound to SYN to *TERMINAL-IO*. *STANDARD-INPUT*
;;;                     and *STANDARD-OUTPUT* are the default streams for READ, PRINT and
;;;                     other things.  *STANDARD-OUTPUT* gets hacked when the session is
;;;                     being scripted, for example.
;;;   *ERROR-OUTPUT*    - This is where error messages should eventually get sent. Initially
;;;                     SYNned to *TERMINAL-IO*.
;;;   *QUERY-IO*        - This is for unexpected user queries of the
;;;                     "Do you really want to ..." variety. Initially SYNned to *TERMINAL-IO*
;;;   *TRACE-OUTPUT*    - Output produced by TRACE goes here.
;;;                      Initially SYNned to *ERROR-OUTPUT*.
