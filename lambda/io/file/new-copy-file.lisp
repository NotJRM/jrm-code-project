  "Copy a file, specified as a pathname, string or I//O stream.
CHARACTERS can be T, NIL, meaning the same as in OPEN.
 or it can be :ASK, meaning always ask the user,
 or :MAYBE-ASK meaning ask the user unless the answer is clear,
 or :DEFAULT meaning guess as well as possible but never ask.
Specify BYTE-SIZE to force copying in a certain byte size.
 BYTE-SIZE affects only binary mode copying.
REPORT-STREAM is a stream to output messages to as files are copied.
 If it is NIL, no messages are output.
COPY-CREATION-DATE if NIL means don't copy the file creation date;
 make now be the new file's creation date.
COPY-AUTHOR if NIL means don't copy the author; make you the new file's author.
CREATE-DIRECTORIES says whether to create a directory to be copied into.
 Values are T, NIL and :QUERY (meaning ask the user if the situation comes up).
Values returned:
1) the first value is normally the defaulted pathname to copy to,
 or a list of such if multiple files were considered.
2) the second value is the old truename of the file considered,
 or a list of old truenames of the files considered.
3) the third value is the outcome, or a list of outcomes.
 An outcome is either a truename if the file was renamed,
 an error object if it failed to be renamed,
 or NIL if the user was asked and said no.
4) the fourth value is a mode of copying, or a list of such.
 A mode of copying is a type specifier such as STRING-CHAR or (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8).
Error objects can appear in the values only if ERROR is NIL."
