 There are two functions for setting up tubes:

 (TUBE:GET-REMOTE-TUBE "<tube-name>")

  Will return all tubes of "<tube-name>" that have been opened up to this machine.

 (TUBE:OPEN-TUBE "<hostname>" "<tube-name>")

 Will open up a tube named "<tube-name>" to the host "<hostname>".


 (TUBE:REMOTE-TUBE-NAMES) returns a list of names for which TUBE:GET-REMOTE-TUBE will
  return a non-null value.

 Tubes may or may not need unique names depending on the setting of the variable

  TUBE:*REMOTE-TUBE-UNIQUE-CHECK-P*, which defaults to T. If this is T then it
  is an error to open more than one tube of a given name to a given host.

 When outputing to a TUBE, use :TYO or any of the usual IO functions such as PRINT.
 A :FORCE-OUTPUT may need to be done on a TUBE to make sure that the output gets to
 the other side (machine).

 When inputting from a TUBE, use :TYI or any of the usual IO functions such as READ.


 A demonstration/test program, TUBE-TALK.
  On machine "LAM-A" do:
    (TUBE:TUBE-TALK "test" "LAM-B")
  On machine "LAM-B" do:
    (TUBE:TUBE-TALK "test")

  This simple demo is like a telephone in that it is confusing to both talk at the same time.


 Debugging functions:
  (TUBE:PRINT-TUBES) prints out information about tubes.
  (TUBE:RESET-TUBES) closes in abort mode all tubes and removes them from the list of tubes.
