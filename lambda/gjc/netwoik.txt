    OCTOBER 3, 1985, GEORGE CARRETTE
    PURPOSE:
     FOR LMI INTERNAL USE AND DISCUSSION
     INFORMATION FOR LMI MARKETTING

LMI presently implements two classes of protocols, the CHAOSNET protocols
which orginated at MIT, and the ARPA or TCP-IP protocols, which has its
origins in the DOD Advanced Research Protects network, or arpanet.

The CHAOSNET protocols were designed (somewhat through evolution)
to provide all the services needed by a network of personal computers
(Lispmachines) connecting to each other and to central timesharing
computers used as MAIL and FILE servers.

The TCP-IP protocols were not designed for a network of personal
computers and did not evolve in such an environment. Instead the
protocols evolved in an environment of MAINFRAMES seperated by
large distances. However, TCP-IP protocols have recently been used
more and more in an environment of personal computers. Some manufacturers
such as SUN and SYMBOLICS have implemented their own protocols of
the TCP-IP class, especially to optimize FILE ACCESS between machines.


LMI's CHAOSNET product provides all the services to make profitable
use of and to do effective software maintainence on its machines.
The TCP-IP product, on the other hand (at this time), is only designed/intended
to provide a way of communicating with other machines that talk
the basic standard TCP-IP protocols, TELNET (remote login),
FTP (file transfer), and SMTP (mail).

Interactive Phone Utility  0             0

Notes:
  1. Mail Receive and forwarding code is available on the Unix processor,
     it is also used in-house on the LAMBDA, the directory containing
     the code is SYS:MAIL; which is not distributed. Setting up mail
     service is a configuration/support problem.
  2. The creation of bidirectional stream oriented user protocols
     and services is about as easy under both TCP-IP and CHAOSNET.

 Legend: Quality of support.
         0 ... not attempted.
         1 ... poor.
         2 ... usable.
         3 ... good.
