

To load the system (make-system'dvi)


You can preview a document with (dvi:show-dvi "angel://lmi//foo//foobar.dvi")


  Then the equivalent of the angel command "iptex"
  is two commands on the lispmachine,

Command 1: You can create an impress file with:

  (dvi:process-dvi "angel://lmi//foo//foobar.dvi" "imagen"
                   :output-file "lam3:foobar;foobar.impress")

This creates foobar.impress. It is better to keep the impress files on a
lispmachine since there is usually more disk space, and it gets around a
bug in hardcopy-file.

Command 2: Then to send it to the imagen:

  (hardcopy-file "foobar.impress" :format :impress)


Integrating text and graphics (screen dumps).


Screen dumps can be made in impress format by setting

  (setq si:*default-bit-array-printer* :impress-bitmap-file)

    or

  (setq si:*default-bit-array-printer*
     '(:impress-bitmap-file "lam3:foobar;bitmap.bits"))

The first case causes the lispm to prompt you in a background window for
the filename every time you do a TERMINAL-Q. The second cases writes out
new versions of "bitmap.bits" on every TERMINAL-Q.

Then to integrate the screen dump into your botex document, use this
sequence in your botex document source:

@tex
     \special{impress-bitmap "lam3:foobar;bitmap.bits"
                              :magnfication 1
                              :h-offset 600
                              :v-offset 600
             }
@end tex


Magnification is given as a power of 2. So 0 means no magnification. 1
means 2, 2 means 4.  The default is 0. The offsets are given in dots,
and the imagen has 300 dots per inch.  The figure will set on the pages
according to H-OFFSET and V-OFFSET, which are ABSOLUTE page coordinates.
The state of the text processing at the time doesnt matter. Usually one
will reserve space with vskip so as to avoid the overlap of text and
graphics.

Also the file "lam3:foobar;bitmap.defaults" may contain default values,
instead of specifying them in the impress-bitmap command:

  (:magnification 1 :h-offset 600 :v-offset 600)

This allows you to change the placement of the bitmap without having to
rerun the lengthy botex command.


Example:


@chapter Diag Window Interface

The window system interface to LAMBDA-DIAG. This is on the key
SYSTEM-GREEK-D. It looks like this in its default configuration:
@figure
@tex \special{impress-bitmap "dj:gjcx;diag-frame-1.bits"} @end(tex)
@vskip 7.5in
@end(figure)



  The file diag-frame-1.defaults contains:

     (:magnification 1
      :h-offset 300.
      :v-offset (+ :pixel-v 150)
      )

The :v-offset is given in terms of the last pixel-v that was in effect
the last time output happened.


Another option is to use images saved form the paint program. That is, using the SAVE
command, *not* the hardcopy command.

@tex
     \special{:saved-paint-image "lam3:foobar;mypaint-1.qfasl"}
@end tex


And "MYPAINT-1.DEFAULTS" would follow the usual rules.
