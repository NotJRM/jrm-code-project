The automatic garbage collector is enabled,
and has recently condemned 351,892 words of volatility 2 storage.

There are 14,073,851 words of dynamic space, 1,590,877 words of static space, and
11,819,992 words of free space.  Free space consists of 9,404,416 words of unallocated
storage plus 1/2 of the 4,831,137 words of storage already allocated to specific
regions but not yet used.

Of the 351,892 words of condemned storage, 109,026 words have already been evacuated
to copyspace.  The scavenger has scanned 78% of the existing scavengeable storage,
with somewhere between 3,457,464 and 3,700,330 words of storage yet to be scanned.
Up to 242,866 words of free space may be required to contain additional evacuated objects.
