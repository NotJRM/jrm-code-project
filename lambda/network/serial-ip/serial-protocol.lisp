This is part of the implementation of the "Serial IP" interface for the
new network system.  This code implements serial connection types, the
serial packet protocol, and low-level serial I/O.  The protocol is
described below.

The key interface routines are as follows:

(MAKE-SERIAL-PROTO-STREAM :TYPE <type>) - connection type determines open
and connection methods to be used.  No other args strictly required, but
these are the ones that can/should be externally settable:

  :TYPE - defaults to :HARDWIRED (default connection, returns T)
  :STREAM - if you default this, send stream ":OPEN T" to OPEN protocol stream
    without calling open method on serial stream
  :OPEN-FCN - a function for :OPEN method to call to open the serial stream;
    defaults to DEFAULT-SERIAL-OPEN-METHOD for all standard connection types.
    Can take any arguments you like; Serial-IP passes it the site's OPEN-ARGS.
  :CONNECT-FCN  - a function for :CONNECT method to call to connect with remote
     port; defaults are appropriate to connect types.
  :CLOSE-FCN - a function for :CLOSE method to call to close the serial stream;
     should take one arg, ABORT-P.
  :TYI-ARGS - a list of arguments to APPLY to the serial stream object.
     For example, on the Lambda:
      (:TYI)            - means wait for a character
      (:TYI-NO-HANG)    - return immediately unless there's a character
      (:TYI-WITH-TIMEOUT <number>) - timeout after <number> * 1/60th second.

(NEW-SERIAL-PROTO-PACKET) - returns a handy packet string; or use your own.

(SERIAL-PROTO-RECEIVE) - asynchronous receive; grab any available input.

(SERIAL-PROTO-SEND) - send a data packet out on serial stream.

(WITH-SERIAL-PORT-ALLOCATED <device>) - allocate and keep the device;
  steal it if necessary.

SERIAL PORT CONNECTION METHODS

A connection method type is denoted by a keyword, which is associated with
open, connect, and close methods. This keyword must have the following
symbol properties:

1. SERIAL-PROTO:OPEN-METHOD - a function to call to open up the serial port.

2. SERIAL-PROTO:CONNECT-METHOD - a function to perform any further processing
over the serial port, e.g. dialing the telephone, modem handshakes, etc.

Any arguments to these functions get passed through the protocol stream's
OPEN or CONNECT method. The stream's :CLOSE method calls the stream's
assigned CLOSE-FCN; this is not associated by keyword, but can be set when
initializing the protocol stream.

Certain standard connection types are defined:

1) :DIAL-UP - arguments tell how to auto-dial the remote site; they are
<TELEPHONE-NUMBER> and <MODEM-TYPE>. The default connection method
(someday????) uses these to auto-dial the modem.

2) :HARDWIRED - hosts are hardwired together.

Implementors may have to define their own site types and/or methods; for
example, if it is necessary to pop up a menu or otherwise prompt for the
operator to specify anything relevant.

In the standard OPEN method, the variable *SERIAL-OPEN-ARGS-ALIST* is an
A-list that, when flattened, specifies any other serial port initialization
that may be required (e.g. parity, stop-bits).

Protocol I/O Stream

A SERIAL-SPROTO-STREAM is defined by DEFSTREAM (implemented by the new
Network software), which creates a DEFSTRUCT that acts much like a
Flavors object; it defines a function which dispatches on a message.

The protocol is taken from a "Serial Line Interface" protocol by
"rick@seismo.ARPA", which does not packetize I/O per se.  Rather, a
special character, SP-FRAME-END, indicates the end-of-packet.  Another
character, SP-FRAME-ESCAPE, is used to precede and "escape" special
characters.  However, the SP-FRAME-END and SP-FRAME-ESCAPE characters
themselves are not send following an escape; translation characters,
SP-FRAME-XEND and SP-FRAME-XESCAPE, are sent.  Thus an SP-FRAME-ESCAPE
or SP-FRAME-END received in the data stream always mean what they say.

A packet is expected to be an array of 8-byte words/characters whose
FILL-POINTER indicates the number of characters already in the packet,
and thus it is the index with which the next character should be read
or written.

Any data or synchronization problem will not be detected; rather, the
user of these packets must figure out whether they got the right stuff.
In the worst case, an escape or end character could be dropped; on the
other hand, eventually an end character will be found, and the packets
will be "in synch" again.  This is OK for Internet.

Input is asynchronous and packetized; output is done all at once.  This
is because we have control over our own output, but may stall for input.
