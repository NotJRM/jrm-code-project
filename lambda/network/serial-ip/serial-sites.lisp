This implements serial I/O handling and remote site definition code, part of
the implementation of the "Serial IP" interface for the new network system.
The actual interface is in the file SERIAL.

On the Lambda, remote serial sites are defined in SYS:SITE;SITE, by the site options
:SERIAL-IP-SITES and :DEFAULT-SERIAL-IP-SITE.  The format of these options is:

(:SERIAL-IP-SITES
  `((<tag> <address> <network> <host-or-gateway> <type> <device> <baud-rate>
           (<open-args>) (<connect-args>))
    :
    :
    ))
(:DEFAULT-SERIAL-IP-SITE <tag>)

Each of these options defines the remote site from the viewpoint of the local
system; in other words, this is information to be used by a system when
opening its serial port and connecting to the particular remote site.  This
works with the Lambda site files, since any exceptions can be defined in
LMLOCS to alter a particular host's view of the remote sites.

The site specification elements are as follows:

<TAG> is a site name; it is used as an id for locating and describing sites.

<ADDRESS> can be the name of a defined Internet host, or an Internet address of
an undefined host; this host presumably answers to and otherwise supports this
serial interface.

<NETWORK> specifies the name or IP address of the Internet on which the serial
host is local.  A network name is compared to the local list of networks to
obtain the network number; an Internet address is parsed and used "as is".
<NETWORK> can be the same as the host address, or NIL, in which case the site
does not represent a gateway.  If <NETWORK> is T, then the site does act as a
gateway to the remote Internet.

Note that for Serial-IP to function properly, the local host must have an
Intenet address on the remote network it is talking to, and vice-versa.  If it
does not, the corresponding network number is used, with unpredictable
results.

<TYPE> is a keyword symbol specifying the manner of connection. Standard
connection types and methods are defined in the file SERIAL-PROTOCOL.

<DEVICE> is a description (probably a string) of the serial port device to be
used.  On the Lambdas, this is/should be limited to "SDU-SERIAL-B".

<BAUD-RATE> is a decimal number indicating the baud rate to be used for the
serial port device.
