Note: One of the things we are trying to be careful about here is our
      process book-keeping. Processes are started up and always recorded
      someplace, on a plist, in a variable, or in a structure slot.
      We always try to :KILL processes which are wedged and useless,
      although we have to be careful (by setting the place the process
      is kept track of in back to NIL when done) not to :KILL a process structure that
      has already been killed. The normal exit of a process or kill of it puts it on the list
      SI:PROCESS-RUN-FUNCTION-SPARE-PROCESSES, which would alow it to be possibly reused again
      by some other call to PROCESS-RUN-FUNCTION, before our own cleanup code would
      get a chance to run.
