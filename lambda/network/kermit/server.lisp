;;; A KERMIT server is a KERMIT program running remotely with no "user
;;; interface". All commands to the server arrive in packets from the
;;; local KERMIT....

;;; Between transactions, a KERMIT server waits for packets containing
;;; server commands. The packet sequence number is always set back to 0
;;; after a transaction. A KERMIT server in command wait should be
;;; looking for packet 0. Certain server commands will result in the
;;; exchange of multiple packets. Those operations proceed exactly like
;;; file transfer.

;;; Server operation must be implemented in two places: in the server
;;; itself, and in any KERMIT program that will be communicating with a
;;; server. The server must have code to read the server commands from
;;; packets and respond to them. the user KERMIT must have code to parse
;;; commands to send requests to servers, to form the server command
;;; packets, and to handle the responses to those server commands....

;;; Server commands are as follows:
;;; S  Send Initiate (exchange parameters, server waits for a file).
;;; R  Receive Initiate (ask the server to send the specified files).
;;; I  Initialize (exchange parameters)....
;;; G  Generic KERMIT Command.  Single character in data field (possibly
;;;    followed by operands, shown in {braces}, optional fields in
;;;    [brackets]) specifies the command:
;;;
;;;    ...
;;;    L  Logout, Bye
;;;    F  Finish (Shut down the server, but don't logout).
;;;    ...

;;; Between transactions, when the server has no tasks pending, it may
;;; send out periodic NAKs (always with type 1 checksums) to prevent a
;;; deadlock in case a command was sent to it but was lost.  These NAKs
;;; can pile up in the local "user" KERMIT's unput buffer (if it has
;;; one), so the user KERMIT should be prepared to clear its input
;;; buffer before sending a command to a server.
