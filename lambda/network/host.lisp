;;; This is SYS: NETWORK; HOST

;;; Host objects:

;;; Host objects have two major uses.  One, they identify a "file
;;; computer" to use inside a pathname.  Two, they serve to canonicalize
;;; name and address mapping on networks.  A comment at the start of
;;; SYS: IO; FILE; PATHNM describes in more detail the pathname parsing
;;; interaction with host objects.

;;; The flavor SI:BASIC-HOST is included in host objects of all types.
;;; The flavor SI:HOST is for hosts which actually correspond to a
;;; particular machine on some network (as opposed to a logical host in
;;; the pathname sense).

;;; Interesting messages on all hosts
;;; :NAME - returns the whole name of the host
;;; :NAME-AS-FILE-COMPUTER - returns what should be printed before the : in pathnames
;;; :PATHNAME-HOST-NAMEP name - is name the name of this host before the : in a pathname?

;;; Interesting messages on network hosts
;;; :SHORT-NAME - returns the shortest nickname from the host table
;;; :SYSTEM-TYPE - returns the operating system type, a symbol in the keyword package, e.g.
;;;                :ITS, :LISPM
;;; :NETWORK-TYPEP network - is this host connected to network, a keyword, e.g. :CHAOS?
;;; :NETWORK-TYPE - returns the major network this host is connected to (i.e. prefers
;;;                :CHAOS)

;;; Relevant functions
;;; SI:PARSE-HOST thing - takes a string and returns a host object corresponding to the
;;;                       network host with that name.  NOT the function used with pathnames.
;;; SI:DEFINE-HOST name &rest options - the form written into host table files.  Defines
;;;                                     a new network host.  Special options include:
;;;     :SYSTEM-TYPE keyword
;;;     :MACHINE-TYPE keyword
;;;     :HOST-NAMES list-of-nicknames
;;;                                     All other options are taken as a network type and
;;;                                     the value as a list of addresses.
;;;                                     The function CHAOS:GENERATE-HOST-TABLE-1 knows how
;;;                                     to make a set of these forms from the HOSTS2 CHAOS
;;;                                     host table.
;;;   Other keywords are for network addresses.
;;; SI:GET-HOST-FROM-ADDRESS address network - returns a host object for address on network.
;;;     E.g. (SI:GET-HOST-FROM-ADDRESS 2026 :CHAOS) => #FS:ITS-HOST "MIT-AI"

;;; Host flavor association
;;; For a particular operating system type (computed from a host table), there should be a
;;; HOST-FLAVOR property.  :DEFAULT is the property for other hosts.
;;; Usually, the HOST-FLAVOR mixes in FS:FILE-HOST-MIXIN (see SYS: IO; FILE; ACCESS) so that
;;; file access can be done to it.

;;; Base flavor, for network and special hosts.
